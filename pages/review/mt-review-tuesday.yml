title: "Midterm Review: TF-IDF and Merging"
context: >
  The problems in this worksheet are taken from past exams in similar classes. Work on them **on paper**, since the exams you take in this course will also be on paper. 
  <br><br>We encourage you to attempt these problems **before** Tuesday's exam review session, so that we have enough time to walk through the solutions to all of the problems.
  <br><br>We will enable the solutions here after the review session, though you can find the written solutions to these problems in other discussion worksheets.
