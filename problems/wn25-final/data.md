Each row in `fish` contains information about a single fish. The
columns in `fish` are as follows:

-   `"Height" (float)`: The height of the fish, in inches.

-   `"Weight" (float)`: The weight of the fish, in grams.

-   `"Species" (str)`: The species of the fish. There are **7** possible species, 5 of which are shown in the example above.

-   `"Width" (float)`: The width of the fish, in inches.

**Throughout the exam**, assume we have already run all necessary import
statements.
