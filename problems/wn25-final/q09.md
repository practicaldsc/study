# BEGIN PROB

Consider a dataset of $n$ non-negative numbers,
$x_1 < x_2 < \ldots < x_n$, that are evenly spaced. In other words,
$x_{i+1} - x_i$ is some fixed positive constant, for all
$i = 1, 2, ..., n-1$. Furthermore, assume that **$n$ is an even integer
that is not a multiple of 4**.

We'd like to use $k$-means clustering to cluster this dataset into
$k = 2$ clusters, Cluster 1 and Cluster 2, defined by two centroids,
$\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, respectively.

Suppose we initialize the two centroids at $\mu_1 = x_1$ and
$\mu_2 = x_2$.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

In iteration **1**, **before** updating the locations of the centroids,
how many points belong to each cluster? Give your answers in the form of
expressions involving $n$ and/or constants.

- Cluster 1: $\_\_\_\_$
- Cluster 2: $\_\_\_\_$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:

- Cluster 1: 1 point
- Cluster 2: $n - 1$ points

<average>77</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

In iteration **1**, **after** updating the locations of the centroids,
both centroids are located exactly at values in the dataset. Which data
point is each centroid now located at? Give your answers in the form of
expressions involving $n$ and/or constants, but **not** $x$. (For
example, if you believe $\mu_2$ is now located at $x_{n-1}$, put $n-1$
in the second box.)

1.  $\mu_1$ is now located at $x_p$, where $p = \hspace{0.05in}$

2.  $\mu_2$ is now located at $x_q$, where $q =$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:

- Cluster 1: $x_1$ (i.e. $p = 1$)
- Cluster 2: $x_\frac{2 + n}{2}$ (i.e. $q = \frac{2 + n}{2} = 1 + \frac{n}{2}$)

<average>75</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

In iteration **2**, **before** updating the locations of the centroids,
how many points belong to each cluster? Give your answers in the form of
expressions involving $n$ and/or constants.

- Cluster 1: $\_\_\_\_$
- Cluster 2: $\_\_\_\_$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:

- Cluster 1: $\frac{n + 2}{4} = \frac{n}{4} + \frac{1}{2}$ points
- Cluster 2: $\frac{3n - 2}{4} = \frac{3n}{4} - \frac{1}{2}$ points

# BEGIN SUBPROB

In one English sentence, name **and** describe the objective function
that $k$-means clustering minimizes.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: The objective function that $k$-means clustering minimizes is called **inertia**, which is the sum of the squared distances between each point and the centroid closest to it.
