In the DataFrame `orders`, assume that:

-   The median delivery time in `"Low"` traffic was 22 minutes.

-   The median delivery time in `"Moderate"` traffic was 31 minutes.

-   The median delivery time in `"High"` traffic was 42 minutes.

-   The median delivery time in `"Very High"` traffic was 60 minutes.

Draw the following visualization, given the information you have.

    orders.plot(kind="box", x="traffic", y="minutes")

While it's not possible to draw the visualization exactly, since you
don't have all of the exact delivery times, it is possible to roughly
sketch it, such that the information provided above is clearly visible.
Some additional instructions:

-   For simplicity, assume that across `"traffic"` categories, the
    variation in delivery times is roughly the same.

-   Make sure your axes are labeled correctly. *(Hint: The $y$-axis
    should have numerical labels.)*
