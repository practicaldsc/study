In Question 7, assuming that there are 100 unique drivers, what is the
true, theoretical probability that `"WOLVAA01"` wins a free gift card?
Show your work, and your final answer, which should be a **fraction**.

Don't spend time on this question if you haven't attempted all other
questions, as it is purely for (very little) extra credit.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer** $\frac{55}{100}$

We have 100 unique drivers and 10 different groups. The probability that `"WOLVAA01"` wins is calculated by adding up the chances that it is chosen in each group.

For each group, the probability of winning depends on how many drivers are in that group. For example:

- In the first group, the probability that `"WOLVAA01"` wins is $\frac{1}{10} \times \frac{1}{100}$.
- In the second group, the probability is $\frac{1}{10} \times \frac{2}{100}$.
- This continues until the tenth group, where the probability is $\frac{1}{10} \times \frac{10}{100}$.

The total probability is the sum of these individual probabilities:
$$
\text{Total Probability} = \frac{1}{10} \times \frac{1}{100} + \frac{1}{10} \times \frac{2}{100} + \cdots + \frac{1}{10} \times \frac{10}{100}
$$
which simplifies to:
$$
\text{Total Probability} = \frac{1}{1000} (1 + 2 + \cdots + 10) = \frac{1}{1000} \times 55 = \frac{55}{1000} = \frac{55}{100}.
$$
