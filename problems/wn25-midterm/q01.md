Driver `"WOLVAA01"` has made several deliveries. Write an expression
that evaluates to the number of minutes `"WOLVAA01"` took to deliver
their **second**-fastest order.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:
```python
    orders.loc[orders["driver"] == "WOLVAA01", "minutes"].sort_values().iloc[1] 
```

or  

```python
    orders.loc[orders["driver"] == "WOLVAA01", "minutes"].sort_values(ascending=False).iloc[-2]
```


`loc` helps us extract a subset of the rows and columns in a DataFrame. In general, `loc` works as follows:

```
    orders.loc[<subset of rows>, <subset of columns>]
```


Here:

- We want all of the rows where `orders["driver"]` is equal to `"WOLVAA01"`, so we use the expression `orders["driver"] == "WOLVAA01"` as the first input to `loc`. (Remember, `orders["driver"] == "WOLVAA01"` is a Series of `True`s and `False`s; only the `True` values are kept in the result.)

- We want just the column `"minutes"`, so we supply it as a string as the second input to `loc`.

Now, we have a Series with the minutes of all orders that `"WOLVAA01"` has reviewed; calling the `.sort_values()` method on this Series will give us back another Series with the minutes of the orders sorted by default in ascending order. Since we are looking for the second fastest order, we can then use `iloc` to extract this value. As Python is zero-indexed this value will be 1. 

Similarly, if you specify `ascending=False` as a parameter to `.sort_values()`, the orders will be sorted in descending order with the order taking the longest amount of time being on top. In such a case, we would want to extract the second last element from the series.
