When we originally downloaded the `orders` dataset from the internet,
some of the values in the `"minutes"` columns were formatted incorrectly
as strings with two decimals in them. To clean the data, we implemented
the function `clean_minutes`, which takes in an invalid minutes value as
a string and returns a correctly formatted minutes value as a float.
Example behavior of `clean_minutes` is given below.

    >>> clean_minutes("8.334.108")
    83.34
    >>> clean_minutes("5.123.999")
    51.23
    >>> clean_minutes("12.091.552")
    120.91
    >>> clean_minutes("525.345.262")
    5253.45

As a helper function, we implemented the function `split_pieces`;
example behavior is given below.

    >>> split_pieces("8.334.108")
    ("8", "334")
    >>> split_pieces("12.091.552")
    ("12", "091")

Fill in the blanks to complete the implementations of the functions
`split_pieces` and `clean_minutes` so that they behave as described
above. Assume that the inputs to both functions are formatted like in
the examples above, i.e. that there are exactly 3 digits between the
middle two decimals.

    def split_pieces(s):
        return re.findall(__(i)__, s)[0]

    def clean_minutes(s):   
        p = split_pieces(s)
        return __(ii)__
