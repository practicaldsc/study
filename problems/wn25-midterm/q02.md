Drivers' ratings can change over time, as they perform more and more
deliveries. For instance, after one delivery a driver's rating might be
4.8, and after their next delivery it might drop to 4.7. We say a driver
is *consistent* if their rating was the **exact same** for all of their
deliveries in `orders`.

Fill in the blanks so `prop_consistent` below evaluates to a float,
corresponding to the **proportion of drivers** who are consistent.

```python
    def f(x):
        return __(iv)__
```

```python
    prop_consistent = (
     orders
     .groupby(__(i)__)
     [__(ii)__]
     .__(iii)__(f)
     .mean()
    )
```

**Answer**

- `(i) "Driver"` -  we use `groupby("Driver")` because we want to check the consistency of ratings for each individual driver. By grouping by "Driver," we are able to look at each driver's set of ratings across their deliveries.

- `(ii) "rating"` - we want to check whether all ratings for a given driver are the same. 

- `(iii) agg` -  The `.agg()` function allows us to apply an aggregation function to each group (driver in this case). This is necessary because we are checking a condition (whether the ratings are the same) for each driver, and `agg` allows us to apply a function that evaluates this condition across all the ratings of a driver.

- `(iv) x.max() == x.min() or x.nunique() == 1` : This is the boolean statement in our `f` function that checks if a driver's ratings are consistent. `x.max() == x.min()` checks if all ratings are the same because if they are, the maximum and minimum will be equal. Alternatively, `x.nunique() == 1` checks if there is only one unique rating, ensuring consistency. Both conditions together guarantee that the driver’s ratings haven’t changed.
