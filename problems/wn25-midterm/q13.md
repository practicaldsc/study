Suppose we'd like to fit a constant model, $H(x_i) = h$, to predict the
number of minutes a delivery will take. To find the optimal constant
prediction, $h^*$, we decide to use the **$\alpha \beta$-balanced** loss
function, defined below:

$$L_{\alpha \beta}(y_i, h) = (\alpha y_i - \beta h)^2$$

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are both constants, and $\beta \neq 0$.

Below, assume $\bar{y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i$ is the mean
number of minutes a delivery took.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose $\alpha = 3$ and $\beta = 3$, so
$L_{\alpha \beta}(y_i, h) = (3y_i - 3h)^2$.

What is the optimal constant prediction, $h^*$, that minimizes average
$\alpha \beta$-balanced loss?

( ) $\bar{y}$ ( ) $\frac{1}{2} \bar{y}$ ( ) $2 \bar{y}$ ( )
$\frac{1}{3} \bar{y}$ ( ) $3 \bar{y}$ ( ) $\frac{1}{6} \bar{y}$ ( )
$6 \bar{y}$

Suppose $\alpha = 6$ and $\beta = 3$, so
$L_{\alpha \beta}(y_i, h) = (6y_i - 3h)^2$.

What is the optimal constant prediction, $h^*$, that minimizes average
$\alpha \beta$-balanced loss?

( ) $\bar{y}$ ( ) $\frac{1}{2} \bar{y}$ ( ) $2 \bar{y}$ ( )
$\frac{1}{3} \bar{y}$ ( ) $3 \bar{y}$ ( ) $\frac{1}{6} \bar{y}$ ( )
$6 \bar{y}$

Find the optimal constant prediction, $h^*$, that minimizes average
$\alpha \beta$-balanced loss **in general**, for any valid choice of
$\alpha$ and $\beta$. Show your work, and $\boxed{\text{box}}$ your
final answer, which should be an expression involving $\bar{y}$,
$\alpha$, $\beta$, and/or other constants.
