Consider the following corpus of two documents:

1.  butter chicken
    $\underbrace{\text{naan naan ... naan}}_{k \text{\: ``naan"s total}}$

2.  curry with naan

The total number of occurrences of "naan\" in document 1 is $k$, so the
total number of terms in document 1 is $k + 2$, where $k \geq 3$ is some
positive integer. Note that the two documents above are the only two
documents in the corpus, meaning that there are 5 unique terms total in
the corpus.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Given that the cosine similarity between the bag-of-words vector
representations of the two documents is $\displaystyle \frac{5}{9}$,
what is the value of $k$?

( ) 3 
( ) 4 
( ) 5
( ) 6 
( ) 7 
( ) 8 
( ) 9 
( ) 10

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer** 5

The vector for Document 1 is:  $\vec{d_1} = (1, 1, k, 0, 0)$ 

The vector for Document 2 is: $\vec{d_2} = (0, 0, 1, 1, 1)$

For the two vectors $\vec{d_1} = (1, 1, k, 0, 0)$ and  $\vec{d_2} = (0, 0, 1, 1, 1)$, the dot product is:
$$
\text{Dot product} = (1)(0) + (1)(0) + (k)(1) + (0)(1) + (0)(1) = k
$$

Next, we need to calculate the magnitudes (or norms) of the two vectors. 
$$
\|\vec{d_1}\| = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + k^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{2 + k^2}
$$

$$
\|\vec{d_2}\| = \sqrt{0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{3}
$$


Now we can calculate the cosine similarity using the formula:
$$
\text{Cosine similarity} = \frac{\text{Dot product}}{\|\vec{d_1}\| \cdot \|\vec{d_2}\|}
$$

Substitute the values we calculated:
$$
\text{Cosine similarity} = \frac{k}{\sqrt{2 + k^2} \cdot \sqrt{3}}
$$

We are given that the cosine similarity is $\frac{5}{9}$. So, we set up the equation:
$$
\frac{k}{\sqrt{2 + k^2} \cdot \sqrt{3}} = \frac{5}{9}
$$

Solving for k gives us 5.

In this part, assume we are using a base-2 logarithm.

(i) Which term in **document 1** has the largest TF-IDF? If there are ties select them all

( ) `butter` 
( ) `chicken`
( ) `naan`
( ) `curry`
( ) `with`


(i) Which term in **document 2** has the largest TF-IDF? If there are ties select them all

( ) `butter` 
( ) `chicken`
( ) `naan`
( ) `curry`
( ) `with`

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**
- `(i)` `butter` and `chicken`
- `(i)` `curry` and `with`


The TF-IDF score of a term in a document is given by:
$$
\text{tf-idf}(t,d) = \text{tf}(t,d) \cdot \text{idf}(t)
                    = \frac{\# \text{ of occurrences of } t \text{ in } d }{\text{total } \# \text{ of terms in } d} \cdot \log_2\left(\frac{\text{total } \# \text{ of documents}}{\# \text{ of documents in which } t \text{ appears}}\right)
$$

**Document 1**:

- `butter`: Appears 1 time in the document, so the TF is $\frac{1}{k+2}$.
- `chicken`: Appears 1 time in the document, so the TF is $\frac{1}{k+2}$.
- `naan`: Appears $k$ times, so the TF is $\frac{k}{k+2}$.
- `curry`: Appears 1 time, so the TF is $\frac{1}{k+2}$.
- `with`: Appears 1 time, so the TF is $\frac{1}{k+2}$.

**Document 2**:

- `curry`: Appears 1 time in the document, so the TF is $\frac{1}{3}$.
- `with`: Appears 1 time, so the TF is $\frac{1}{3}$.
- `naan`: Appears 1 time, so the TF is $\frac{1}{3}$.

The IDF for terms is computed based on their presence across both documents:

- For terms like `butter`, `chicken`, and `naan` in document 1, the IDF will be based on their presence across both documents.
- For terms like `curry` and `with` in document 2, they will have a higher IDF.

The terms `butter`, `chicken` in document 1 and `curry`, `with` in document 2 have the largest TF-IDF scores, respectively, due to their unique occurrences in each document.

This part is independent of the previous parts.

In practice, you'll encounter lots of new metrics and formulas that you
need to make sense of on the job. For instance, the **Wolverine Score
(WS)**, defined below, is an alternative to the TF-IDF that also tries
to quantify the importance of a term $t$ to a document $d$, given a
corpus of documents $d_1, d_2, ..., d_n$.

$$
\text{WS}(t, d) = \left( \frac{\text{total \# of terms in } d}{\text{\# of occurrences of } t \text{ in } d} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \text{\# of occurrences of } t \text{ in } d_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n \text{total \# of terms in } d_i} \right)
$$

Fill in the blank to complete the statement below.

"If `___`, then term $t$ is more common in document $d$ than it is
across the entire corpus, and so $t$ is likely an important term in
$d$.\"

What goes in the blank?

( ) $\text{WS}(t, d) < 0$
( ) $\text{WS}(t, d) > 0$
( ) $\text{WS}(t, d) < 1$
( ) $\text{WS}(t, d) > 1$
( ) $\text{WS}(t, d) < \frac{1}{n}$, where $n$ is the number of documents in the corpus
( ) $\text{WS}(t, d) > \frac{1}{n}$, where $n$ is the number of documents in the corpus

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer** $\text{WS}(t, d) < 1$

The **Wolverine Score (WS)** compares the occurrence of a term $t$ within a document $d$ relative to its occurrence across the entire corpus. If the value of WS for a term is less than 1, it indicates that the term $t$ is more common in document $d$ than it is in the overall corpus. This implies that the term is likely an important term for document $d$.

The WS formula suggests that if the term $t$ occurs more frequently in document $d$ relative to its occurrence in the entire corpus, the WS score will be less than 1, making $t$ a significant term for document $d$.
