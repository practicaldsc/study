Consider the following corpus of two documents:

1.  butter chicken
    $\underbrace{\text{naan naan ... naan}}_{k \text{\: ``naan"s total}}$

2.  curry with naan

The total number of occurrences of "naan\" in document 1 is $k$, so the
total number of terms in document 1 is $k + 2$, where $k \geq 3$ is some
positive integer. Note that the two documents above are the only two
documents in the corpus, meaning that there are 5 unique terms total in
the corpus.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Given that the cosine similarity between the bag-of-words vector
representations of the two documents is $\displaystyle \frac{5}{9}$,
what is the value of $k$?

( ) 3 ( ) 4 ( ) 5 ( ) 6 ( ) 7 ( ) 8 ( ) 9 ( ) 10

In practice, you'll encounter lots of new metrics and formulas that you
need to make sense of on the job. For instance, the **Wolverine Score
(WS)**, defined below, is an alternative to the TF-IDF that also tries
to quantify the importance of a term $t$ to a document $d$, given a
corpus of documents $d_1, d_2, ..., d_n$.

$$\text{WS}(t, d) = \left( \frac{\text{total # of terms in $d$}}{\text{# of occurrences of $t$ in $d$}} \right) \cdot   \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \text{# of occurrences of $t$ in $d_i$}}{\sum_{i=1}^n \text{total # of terms in $d_i$}}\right)$$

Fill in the blank to complete the statement below.

"If `____`, then term $t$ is more common in document $d$ than it is
across the entire corpus, and so $t$ is likely an important term in
$d$.\"

What goes in the blank?

( ) $\text{WS}(t, d) < 0$
( ) $\text{WS}(t, d) > 0$
( ) $\text{WS}(t, d) < 1$
( ) $\text{WS}(t, d) > 1$
( ) $\text{WS}(t, d) < \frac{1}{n}$, where $n$ is the number of documents in the corpus
( ) $\text{WS}(t, d) > \frac{1}{n}$, where $n$ is the number of documents in the corpus
