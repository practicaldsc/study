Consider the following corpus of two documents:

1.  butter chicken
    $\underbrace{\text{naan naan ... naan}}_{k \text{\: ``naan"s total}}$

2.  curry with naan

The total number of occurrences of "naan\" in document 1 is $k$, so the
total number of terms in document 1 is $k + 2$, where $k \geq 3$ is some
positive integer. Note that the two documents above are the only two
documents in the corpus, meaning that there are 5 unique terms total in
the corpus.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Given that the cosine similarity between the bag-of-words vector
representations of the two documents is $\displaystyle \frac{5}{9}$,
what is the value of $k$?

( ) 3 
( ) 4 
( ) 5
( ) 6 
( ) 7 
( ) 8 
( ) 9 
( ) 10

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: 5

The bag of words vector for Document 1 is:  $$\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ k \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$
 

The bag of words vector for Document 2 is:$$\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

The cosine similarity can be calculated using the formula:
$$
\text{cosine sim}(\vec d_1, \vec d_2) = \frac{\vec d_1 \cdot \vec d_2}{\lVert d_1 \rVert \lVert d_2 \rVert}
$$

For the two vectors $\vec{d_1} = (1, 1, k, 0, 0)$ and  $\vec{d_2} = (0, 0, 1, 1, 1)$, the dot product is:
$$
\text{Dot product} = (1)(0) + (1)(0) + (k)(1) + (0)(1) + (0)(1) = k
$$

Next, we need to calculate the magnitudes (or norms) of the two vectors. 
$$
\|\vec{d_1}\| = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + k^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{2 + k^2}
$$

$$
\|\vec{d_2}\| = \sqrt{0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{3}
$$

Substitute the values we calculated:
$$
\text{Cosine similarity} = \frac{k}{\sqrt{2 + k^2} \cdot \sqrt{3}}
$$

We are given that the cosine similarity is $\frac{5}{9}$. So, we set up the equation:
$$
\frac{k}{\sqrt{2 + k^2} \cdot \sqrt{3}} = \frac{5}{9}
$$

Solving for `k` gives us 5.

In this part, assume we are using a base-2 logarithm.

(i) Which term in **document 1** has the largest TF-IDF? If there are ties, select them all.

[ ] butter
[ ] chicken
[ ] naan
[ ] curry
[ ] with

(ii) Which term in **document 2** has the largest TF-IDF? If there are ties, select them all.

[ ] butter
[ ] chicken
[ ] naan
[ ] curry
[ ] with

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**:

- butter and chicken

- curry and with


The TF-IDF score of a term in a document is given by:
$$
\text{tf-idf}(t,d) = \text{tf}(t,d) \cdot \text{idf}(t)
                    = \frac{\# \text{ of occurrences of } t \text{ in } d }{\text{total } \# \text{ of terms in } d} \cdot \log_2\left(\frac{\text{total } \# \text{ of documents}}{\# \text{ of documents in which } t \text{ appears}}\right)
$$

TF-IDF scores are high when:

1. A term occurs frequently in the document (high TF), and

2. A term appears in few documents in the corpus (high IDF).

**Naan** appears in both documents, so its IDF is 0 and its TF-IDF is 0 in both.

**Butter** and **chicken** each appear only once, and only in document 1. So their TF is low, but their IDF is high.

**Curry** and **with** each appear only once, and only in document 2. So they also have high IDF and non-zero TF.

Therefore, **butter** and **chicken** have the highest TF-IDF in document 1, and **curry** and **with** in document 2.

This part is independent of the previous parts.

In practice, you'll encounter lots of new metrics and formulas that you
need to make sense of on the job. For instance, the **Wolverine Score
(WS)**, defined below, is an alternative to the TF-IDF that also tries
to quantify the importance of a term $t$ to a document $d$, given a
corpus of documents $d_1, d_2, ..., d_n$.

$$
\text{WS}(t, d) = \left( \frac{\text{total \# of terms in } d}{\text{\# of occurrences of } t \text{ in } d} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \text{\# of occurrences of } t \text{ in } d_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n \text{total \# of terms in } d_i} \right)
$$

Fill in the blank to complete the statement below.

"If `___`, then term $t$ is more common in document $d$ than it is
across the entire corpus, and so $t$ is likely an important term in
$d$.\"

What goes in the blank?

( ) $\text{WS}(t, d) < 0$
( ) $\text{WS}(t, d) > 0$
( ) $\text{WS}(t, d) < 1$
( ) $\text{WS}(t, d) > 1$
( ) $\text{WS}(t, d) < \frac{1}{n}$, where $n$ is the number of documents in the corpus
( ) $\text{WS}(t, d) > \frac{1}{n}$, where $n$ is the number of documents in the corpus

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: $\text{WS}(t, d) < 1$

The Wolverine Score compares a termâ€™s relative frequency in document $d$ versus its average frequency in the entire corpus.

The first part of WS, $\frac{\text{total terms in } d}{\# \text{ of occurrences of } t \text{ in } d}$, is the inverse of how frequent $t$ is in $d$.

The second part, $\frac{\text{total occurrences of } t \text{ in corpus}}{\text{total terms in corpus}}$, is the overall frequency of $t$.

If WS is less than 1, it means that the term occurs more often *within* $d$ than *on average* across all documents. This implies that the term is especially important or relevant to $d$.

Example: If a term appears 5 times in a 10-word document (50%), but only 10 times in a 100-word corpus (10%), then:
$$
\text{WS} = \left(\frac{10}{5}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{10}{100}\right) = 2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.2 < 1
$$
So WS < 1 means the term is concentrated in $d$.
