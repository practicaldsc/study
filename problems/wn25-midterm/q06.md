# BEGIN PROB

Consider the DataFrames `A` and `B`, shown below in their entirety.

<img src="../assets/images/wn25-midterm/B.png" width=40%>
</center>

Note that the `"type"` value in row **3** of DataFrame `B` is unknown.  
Remember from the Data Overview page that the only possible values in the `"type"` column are `"Buffet"`, `"Drinks"`, `"Meal"`, and `"Snack"`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose the DataFrame `A.merge(B, on="type")` has 7 rows.

What must the unknown value, $\boxed{\text{???}}$, be?

( ) `"Drinks"`  
( ) `"Buffet"`  
( ) `"Meal"`  
( ) `"Snack"`  

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `"Drinks"`

Given that the resulting DataFrame after the merge has 7 rows, this means that there are 7 matches between the rows in A and B based on the `"type"` column. The value in the third row of DataFrame B is unknown. We need to figure out which value for `"type"` will give exactly 7 matches when merged with A.

Since merging on `"type"` generates rows where both DataFrames have the same `"type"`, we need to look at the counts of each type in A and B to deduce which value the unknown `"type"` should be. We can see that there are 5 rows with type `"Buffet"` in DataFrame A and 1 row with type `"Buffet"` in DataFrame B. This means in our merged dataset we will have at least 5 rows of `"Buffet"`.

We can then go through each of the different options to see which option will give us exactly 7 rows in our merged dataset. If the unknown value is:

- **Drinks**: We have 2 rows with type `"Drinks"` in DataFrame A and 1 row with type `"Drinks"` (unknown value replaced) in DataFrame B, which gives us $2 \times 1 = 2$ rows in our merged dataset. This is the correct answer because now we will have 5 (Buffet rows) + 2 (Drinks rows) = 7 rows in the merged dataset.

- **Buffet**: We have 5 rows of `"Buffet"` in DataFrame A and 2 rows in DataFrame B, which gives us $2 \times 5 = 10$ rows in our merged dataset.

- **Meal**: We have 0 rows of `"Meal"` in DataFrame A and 2 row in DataFrame B, which gives us $0 \times 2 = 0$ row in our merged dataset.

- **Snack**: We have 0 rows of `"Snack"` in DataFrame A and 3 rows in DataFrame B, which gives us $0 \times 3 = 0$ rows in our merged dataset. This is the correct answer because now we will have exactly 10 rows (all Buffet rows) in total.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose the DataFrame `A.merge(B, on="type")` has 10 rows.

What must the unknown value, $\boxed{\text{???}}$, be?

( ) `"Drinks"`  
( ) `"Buffet"`  
( ) `"Meal"`  
( ) `"Snack"`  

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `"Buffet"`

Using the same logic as in the solution to 6.1, if the unknown value is `"Buffet"`, the merged dataset will include:

- `5` (`Buffet rows from A`) * `2` (`Buffet rows from B`) = `10` rows.

This matches the stated total, so the unknown must be `"Buffet"`.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose the DataFrame `A.merge(B, on="type", how="outer")` has $k$ rows.  
The value of $k$ depends on the unknown value, $\boxed{\text{???}}$.

Which integer below **cannot** be $k$?

( ) 11  
( ) 12  
( ) 14  
( ) 16  

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `14`

We can replace the unknown value with each type and compute how many rows we expect to see in the final dataset after an outer merge:

- If the unknown value is **Drinks**: We will have 2 (Drinks rows) + 5 (Buffet rows) + 2 (Meal rows) + 2 (Snack rows) = 11 rows.
- If the unknown value is **Buffet**: We will have 10 (Buffet rows) + 2 (Drink rows from DataFrame A) + 2 (Meal rows) + 2 (Snack rows) = 16 rows.
- If the unknown value is **Meal**: We will have 3 (Meal rows) + 5 (Buffet rows) + 2 (Drink rows) + 2 (Snack rows) = 12 rows.
- If the unknown value is **Snack**: We will have 3 (Snack rows) + 5 (Buffet rows) + 2 (Meal rows) + 2 (Meal rows) = 12 rows.

Thus, the only possible number of rows that **cannot** occur is **14**.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose the unknown value, $\boxed{\text{???}}$, is `"Buffet"`.

How many rows are in the DataFrame `A.merge(B, on=["type", "rating"])`?

( ) 0  
( ) 1  
( ) 2  
( ) 3  
( ) 4  
( ) 5  
( ) 6  
( ) 7  

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `2`

When merging on both `"type"` and `"rating"`, only exact matches in both columns will contribute to the result. Since the unknown value is `"Buffet"`, the only matching combination is `"Buffet"` with rating `4.6`, which appears once in each DataFrame.

Thus, the total number of rows is `1 (from A) * 1 (from B) = 1` per matching pair, and if both datasets hold one each, the result has `2` rows.
