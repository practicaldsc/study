Consider the DataFrames `A` and `B`, shown below in their entirety.

::: center
![image](midterm-images/A.png){width="40%"}
![image](midterm-images/B.png){width="40%"}
:::

Note that the `"type"` value in row **3** of DataFrame `B` is unknown.
Remember from the Data Overview page that the only possible values in
the `"type"` column are `"Buffet"`, `"Drinks"`, `"Meal"`, and `"Snack"`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose the DataFrame `A.merge(B, on="type")` has `7` rows.

What must the unknown value, $\boxed{\text{???}}$, be? ( ) Drinks ( )
Buffet ( ) Meal ( ) Snack

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose the DataFrame `A.merge(B, on="type")` has `10` rows.

What must the unknown value, $\boxed{\text{???}}$, be?

( ) `"Drinks"` ( ) `"Buffet"` ( ) `"Meal"` ( ) `"Snack"`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose the DataFrame `A.merge(B, on="type", how="outer")` has $k$ rows.
The value of $k$ depends on the unknown value, $\boxed{\text{???}}$.

Which integer below **cannot** be $k$?

( ) 11 ( ) 12 ( ) 14 ( ) 16

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose the unknown value, $\boxed{\text{???}}$, is `"Buffet"`.

( ) 0 ( ) 1 ( ) 2 ( ) 3 ( ) 4 ( ) 5 ( ) 6 ( ) 7
