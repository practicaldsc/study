In one English sentence, describe what the following expression
computes. Your sentence should start with "The driver\", and should be
understandable by someone who has never written code before, i.e. it
should not use any technical terms.

```python
    (orders
        .groupby("driver")
        .filter(lambda df: df.shape[0] >= 10 and df["rating"].min() >= 4.5)
        .groupby("driver")
        ["minutes"]
        .sum()
        .idxmax()
    )
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**  The driver who has driven the most minutes total, among all drivers with at least 10 deliveries and a minimum review of 4.5.

The expression first groups the data by the driver column (`.groupby("driver")`). After which it filters out drivers who have made fewer than 10 deliveries or have a minimum rating below 4.5. Only drivers who meet both conditions (at least 10 deliveries and a minimum rating of 4.5) remain in the output df. After filtering, the expression groups the data by driver again and sums up the total minutes each driver has driven.
Lastly, the `.idxmax()` finds the driver who has the maximum total minutes driven. This is the driver who drove the most minutes.
