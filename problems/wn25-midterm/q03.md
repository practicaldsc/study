Suppose the expression below evaluates to `1`.

```python
(orders[orders["type"] == "Snack"]["driver"]
 .value_counts()
 .value_counts()
 .shape[0]
)
```

What can we conclude about `orders`?

( ) Every driver made at least 1 `"Snack"` delivery.
( ) Every driver made exactly 1 `"Snack"` delivery.
( ) Every driver made at most 1 `"Snack"` delivery.
( ) Every driver made exactly $k$ `"Snack"` deliveries, where $k$ is some positive constant.
( ) Every driver made exactly 0 or exactly $k$ `"Snack"` deliveries, where $k$ is some positive constant.
( ) Every driver that made a `"Snack"` delivery did not make any other kind of delivery.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: Every driver made exactly 0 or exactly $k$ `"Snack"` deliveries, where $k$ is some positive constant.

The expression runs a query on the `orders` DataFrame, selecting only rows where the `"type"` is equal to `"Snack"`. This narrows the focus to the set of deliveries that were for `"Snack"` items. The code then selects the `"driver"` column to identify which driver handled each `"Snack"` delivery.

The first `.value_counts()` computes how many `"Snack"` deliveries each `"driver"` made. The second `.value_counts()` then counts how many drivers made each possible number of `"Snack"` deliveries.

Finally, `.shape[0]` measures how many distinct numbers of `"Snack"` deliveries were made by drivers. Since the expression evaluates to `1`, we can conclude that there is only one distinct number of `"Snack"` deliveries made by drivers. This implies that every driver either made exactly 0 or exactly $k$ `"Snack"` deliveries.
