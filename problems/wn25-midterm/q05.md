Consider the DataFrame `C`, defined below.

```python
C = orders.pivot_table(
  index="type",  # Possible values: "Buffet", "Drinks", "Meal", "Snack"
  columns="traffic",  # Possible values: "High", "Low", "Moderate", "Very Low"
  values="minutes",
  aggfunc="count"
)
```

Throughout this question, assume that after defining `C` above, **we sort `C` such that both its index and columns are in ascending alphabetical order** (as shown above).

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks so that the expression below evaluates to the **proportion of `"Snack"` deliveries that were made in `"Moderate"` traffic**. Each blank should be filled with a single integer, float, string, or Boolean value.

```python
C.iloc[__(i)__, __(ii)__] / C.loc[__(iii)__].sum()
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: There are multiple possible answers.

- (i): `3 or -1`. The index of `C` is sorted alphabetically, meaning the row order follows `"Buffet"`, `"Drinks"`, `"Meal"`, `"Snack"`. Since `"Snack"` is the last item in this order, its index is 3 (0-based) or -1 (negative indexing).

- (ii): `2 or -2`. Similarly, the columns are sorted alphabetically: `"High"`, `"Low"`, `"Moderate"`, `"Very Low"`. `"Moderate"` appears third in this order, making its index 2 (0-based) or -2 (negative indexing).

- (iii): `"Snack"`. To get the total number of `"Snack"` deliveries across all traffic levels, we use `C.loc["Snack"]`. The `.sum()` function then adds up all values in that row.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks so that the expression below evaluates to the **proportion of deliveries made in `"Low"` traffic that were for `"Buffet"`**. Blanks (i) and (ii) should each be filled with a single integer, float, string, or Boolean value.

```python
C.loc[__(i)__, __(ii)__] / __(iii)__.sum()
```

Options for (iii):  

( ) `C.iloc[:, -1]`  
( ) `C.iloc[:, 0]`  
( ) `C.iloc[:, 1]`  
( ) `C.iloc[-1, :]`  
( ) `C.iloc[0, :]`  
( ) `C.iloc[1, :]`  

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**:
- (i): `"Buffet"`. When using `.loc`, we reference labels instead of numerical indices. Since the index represents order `"type"` and is sorted alphabetically (`"Buffet"`, `"Drinks"`, `"Meal"`, `"Snack"`), `"Buffet"` is the correct label for selecting the row corresponding to buffet orders.

- (ii): `"Low"`. Similarly, the column order is sorted alphabetically as `"High"`, `"Low"`, `"Moderate"`, `"Very Low"`, making `"Low"` the correct column label to select deliveries in `"Low"` traffic.

- (iii): `C.iloc[:, 1]`. Here, we are using `.iloc`, which is integer-location based indexing. The `[:, 1]` part means we are selecting all rows (`:`) in the second column (index 1), which corresponds to `"Low"` traffic, since the columns are sorted alphabetically. By selecting `C.iloc[:, 1]`, we are referencing all the values in the `"Low"` column, and `.sum()` will give the total number of deliveries made in `"Low"` traffic across all order types.
