Consider the DataFrame `C`, defined below.

    C = orders.pivot_table(
      index="type", # Possible values: "Buffet", "Drinks", "Meal", "Snacks"
      columns="traffic", # Possible values: "High", "Low", "Moderate", "Very Low"
      values="minutes",
      aggfunc="count"
    )

Throughout this question, assume that after defining `C` above, **we
sort `C` such that both its index and columns are in ascending
alphabetical order** (as shown above).

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks so that the expression below evaluates to the
**proportion of `"Snack"` deliveries that were made in `"Moderate"`
traffic**. Each blank should be filled with a single integer, float,
string, or Boolean value.

    C.iloc[__(i)__, __(ii)__] / C.loc[__(iii)__].sum()



# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: There are multiple possible answers - 
- `(i)` 3 or -1 - 

- `(ii) 2 or -2  - we want to check whether all ratings for a given driver are the same. 

- `(iii) agg` -  The `.agg()` function allows us to apply an aggregation function to each group (driver in this case). This is necessary because we are checking a condition (whether the ratings are the same) for each driver, and `agg` allows us to apply a function that evaluates this condition across all the ratings of a driver.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks so that the expression below evaluates to the
**proportion of deliveries made in `"Low"` traffic that were for
`"Buffet"`s**. Blanks (i) and (ii) should each be filled with a single
integer, float, string, or Boolean value.

    C.loc[__(i)__, __(ii)__] / __(iii)__.sum()

`(i)`: `(ii)`:

`(iii)`:

  --------------------- -- --
  ( ) `C.iloc[:, -1]`      
  ( ) `C.iloc[-1, :]`      
  --------------------- -- --

In one English sentence, describe what the following expression
computes. Your sentence should be understandable by someone who has
never written code before, i.e. it should not use any technical terms.
