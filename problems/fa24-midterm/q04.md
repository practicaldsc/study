The bar chart below shows the distribution of the number of reviews per
`"author"` in `reviews`. For instance, it's telling us that
approximately 120 `"author"`s wrote 2 reviews. **Assume that the height
of the bar at 8 on the $x$-axis is exactly 1, and that this is the
shortest bar (with no ties).**

Hint: The **values** in the Series that results from calling
`value_counts()` are sorted in descending order.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blank below so that `W` evaluates to the value `7`.

```python
W = reviews["author"].value_counts().__(i)__
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: There are a few valid answers, namely:

- `iloc[1]`.
- `iloc[2]`.
- `value_counts().index[-2]`.
- `value_counts().index[6]`.

`reviews["author"].value_counts()` is a **Series** where:
- The index contains all of the unique values in `reviews["author"]`.
- The values contain the frequencies (i.e. counts) of each value in `reviews["author"]`.

In other words, `reviews["author"].value_counts()` tells us **the number of reviews per `"author"`**.

What do we know about `reviews["author"].value_counts()` from the question? 

- Much of our information comes from the bar chart, which is showing us the number of `"author"`s that wrote 1 review, the number of `"author"`s that wrote 2 reviews, etc.
- Since the height of the bar at 8 is 1, and this is the shortest bar, we know that exactly 1 `"author"` wrote 8 reviews, and the author with the next most reviews was 7.

As the question hints to us, `reviews["author"].value_counts()` is sorted in decreasing order of value by default. Putting the information above together, we know that the first few rows of `reviews["author"].value_counts()` looks like:

```
Most Common Author      8
Someone else            7
A third person          7
...
```

With that in mind, `reviews["author"].value_counts().iloc[0]` would give us 8, and `reviews["author"].value_counts().iloc[1]` would give us 7. So, **`iloc[1]`** and **`iloc[2]** are two ways of answering this part. There are other solutions, but they involve understanding how `reviews["author"].value_counts().value_counts()` works, which we will save for the solution of the next part.

If it's helpful, here's what `reviews["author"].value_counts()` actually looks like on the full DataFrame we used to make this exam:

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

Now, consider the values defined below.

```python
W = reviews["author"].value_counts().value_counts().loc[1]
X = reviews["author"].value_counts().value_counts().iloc[1]
Y = reviews["author"].value_counts().value_counts().index[1]
Z = reviews["author"].value_counts().value_counts().index[-1]
```

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which value is equal to **8**?

( ) `W` 
( ) `X` 
( ) `Y` 
( ) `Z` 
( ) None of these.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `Z = reviews["author"].value_counts().value_counts().index[-1]`.

In the solution to the previous part, we understood that `reviews["author"].value_counts()` would look something like:

```
Most Common Author      8
Someone else            7
A third person          7
...
```

Then, what does `reviews["author"].value_counts().value_counts()` look like? It's a **Series**, too, where:

- The index contains all of the unique values in `reviews["author"].value_counts()` (so 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 8).
- The values tell us the number of `"author"`s with 1 review, the number of `"author"`s with 2 reviews, etc.

So, `reviews["author"].value_counts().value_counts()` actually describes the information in the bar chart provided! It may look something like:

```
1           1400
2           120
3           25
5           12
6           9
4           8
7           2
8           1
```

The only one of these values that we know exactly is in the very last row, because we're told that exactly one `"author"` wrote 8 reviews, the rest wrote fewer. The other values were estimated from the provided bar chart, but their values are not important in answering any of the remaining parts of this question.

Keep in mind that the resulting Series is sorted in descending order of **value**, not by index!

So, we can answer all three remaining parts of this question at once:

- **Part 2**: Since the bar for 8 is the shortest bar, 8 is the very last value in the index of `reviews["author"].value_counts().value_counts()`, so `Z = reviews["author"].value_counts().value_counts().index[-1]` must evaluate to `8`.
- **Part 3**: `W = reviews["author"].value_counts().value_counts().loc[1]` will give us the value at index `1`, which will be the number of `"author"`s with 1 review, which is the height of the first bar.
- **Part 4**: `X = reviews["author"].value_counts().value_counts().iloc[1]` will give us the value at integer position 1. Since Python is 0-indexed, this will give us the second-largest value in `reviews["author"].value_counts().value_counts()`, which is the height of the second-tallest bar, which is indeed what we want.
