Consider the DataFrame `framer`, defined below.

```python
framer = reviews.pivot_table(index="airline",
                                columns="cabin",
                                values="author",
                                aggfunc="max")
```

# BEGIN SUBPROB

In one English sentence, describe the meaning of the **value** that the
following expression evaluates to.

```python
framer.loc["emirates", "Economy"]
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: The last name, alphabetically, among all authors who submitted an
Economy Class Emirates review.

`framer` might look something like this:

</center>

The rows of `framer` are the unique `"airline"`s and the columns of `framer` are the unique `"cabin"`s. The value in row `a` and column `c` is the maximum `"author"` who wrote a review for `"airline"` `a` in `"cabin"` `c`. Since `"author"` names are strings, the "maximum" `"author"` name is the last alphabetically (or _lexicographically_).

What is the value of the following expression?

```python
framer.isna().sum(axis=0).shape[0]
```

( ) The number of unique values in the `"airline"` column of `reviews`.
( ) The number of unique values in the `"cabin"` column of `reviews`.
( ) The number of unique values in the `"author"` column of `reviews`.
( ) The number of unique values in the `"overall"` column of `reviews`.
( ) None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: The number of unique values in the `"cabin"` column of `reviews`.

Let's walk through the logic:

- `framer` has one column per unique `"cabin"` in `reviews`.
- `framer.isna()` is a DataFrame with the same shape as `framer`, with each value either being `True` (if the corresponding value in `framer` is null) or `False`.
- `framer.isna().sum(axis=0)` computes the sum across the rows, which is the sum **of each column** of `framer`.
- So, the Series `framer.isna().sum(axis=0)` has one entry per column in `framer`, i.e. one entry per unique `"cabin"` in reviews.
- So, `framer.isna().sum(axis=0).shape[0]` is equal to the number of unique values in the `"cabin"` column of `reviews`.

Consider the following information.

```python
>>> framer.isna().sum(axis=0).sum()
320
>>> reviews["airline"].nunique()
125
>>> reviews["cabin"].nunique()
4
```

What is the value of the following expression? Show your work, and
$\boxed{\text{box}}$ your final answer, which should be a **positive
integer**.

```python
reviews.groupby(["airline", "cabin"])["overall"].mean().shape[0]
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 180.

Let `grouped = reviews.groupby(["airline", "cabin"])["overall"].mean()`, the DataFrame provided in the question. `grouped` has one row for every unique combination of `"airline"` and `"cabin"` that actually appears in `reviews`. Since there are 125 unique values of `"airline"` and 4 unique values of `"cabin"`, there are $125 \cdot 4 = 500$ _possible_ unique combinations of `"airline"` and `"cabin"`.

**But**, these combinations don't all actually exist in `grouper`! The fact that `framer.isna().sum(axis=0).sum()` is `320` means that there are 320 missing values in `framer`, total. `framer`, too, has 125 rows and 4 columns, since it results from calling `reviews.pivot_table(index="airline", columns="cabin")`. But, since it has 320 missing values, it means that 320 of the possible combinations of `"airline"` and `"cabin"` never actually appeared in `reviews`.

So, the number of combinations of `"airline"` and `"cabin"` that actually appeared in `reviews` is equal to the number of non-null values in `framer` â€“ or, equivalently, the number of rows in `grouped` (so `grouped.shape[0]`), which is the answer to the question we're looking for â€“ is:

$$125 \cdot 4 - 320 = \boxed{180}$$
