Consider the DataFrame `lines`, created by keeping the rows in `reviews`
corresponding to reviews written between 2015-11-24 and 2015-11-28.
Remember, each row in `lines` corresponds to a review of an **airline**.

Also consider the DataFrame `ports`, in which each row corresponds to a
review of a particular **airport**. `ports` has a `"date"` column, too,
and also only has reviews written between 2015-11-24 and 2015-11-28.

Consider the following information.

```python
>>> lines["date"].value_counts().sort_index()
2015-11-24      2
2015-11-25      7
2015-11-26      1
2015-11-27      4
>>> ports.shape[0]
17
>>> ports["date"].unique()
array(["2015-11-26", "2015-11-27", "2015-11-28"])
>>> lines.merge(ports, on="date", how="inner").shape[0]
29
>>> lines.merge(ports, on="date", how="outer").shape[0]
41
```

Below, give your answers as **integers**.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

How many values in `ports["date"]` are equal to `"2015-11-24"`?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 0.

Since `ports["date"].unique()` evaluates to `array(["2015-11-26", "2015-11-27", "2015-11-28"])`, we know that none of the values in `ports["date"]` are `"2015-11-24"`.

How many values in `ports["date"]` are equal to `"2015-11-26"`?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 9.

Let:

- the number of values in `ports["date"]` equal to `"2015-11-26"` be $a$, 
- the number of values in `ports["date"]` equal to `"2015-11-27"` be $b$, and
- the number of values in `ports["date"]` equal to `"2015-11-28"` be $c$.

Then, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the answers to parts 3, 4, and 5 of this question, respectively.

To solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$, we'll need to put together several pieces of information:

- Since `ports.shape[0]` is `17`, the total number of values in `ports["date"]` is 17. We know, from the fact that `ports["date"].unique()` is `array(["2015-11-26", "2015-11-27", "2015-11-28"])`, that the only values in `ports["date"]` are `"2015-11-26"`, `"2015-11-27"`, and `"2015-11-28"`. This means that $a + b + c = 17$ â€“ we'll call this equation 1.
- There are 29 rows when we perform an inner merge between `lines` and `ports` on `"date"`. The only unique values that are shared between `lines["date"]` and `ports["date"]` are `"2015-11-26"` (1 in `lines`, $a$ in `ports`) and `"2015-11-27"` (4 in `lines`, $b$ in `ports`). So, because of the fact that:
$$\underbrace{\text{frequency}(\text{value}, \texttt{merged(lines, dates)} = \text{frequency}(\text{value}, \texttt{lines}) \cdot \text{frequency}(\text{value}, \texttt{dates})}_{\text{this is not a formula we saw explicitly in class; rather, it's a principle we used repeatedly when solving number-of-rows-in-merges problems}}$$
    We have our equation 2:
    $$1a + 4b = 29$$
- Finally, there are 41 rows we perform an outer merge between `lines` and `ports` on `"date"`. The rows in the result of the outer merge are all 29 rows of the inner merge, plus one row each for each row that was in `lines` or `dates` without an overlapping `"date"`. So, equation 3 is:
$$\underbrace{29}_{\text{inner merge}} + \underbrace{2 + 7}_{\text{the frequencies of \texttt{"2015-11-24"} and \texttt{"2015-11-25"} in \texttt{lines}}} + \underbrace{c}_\text{the frequency of \texttt{"2015-11-28"} in \texttt{ports}} = 41$$

So, our three equations are:

$$\begin{align} a + b + c &= 17\\ a + 4b &= 29\\ 29 + 2 + 7 + c &= 41\end{align}$$

Let's work our way to a solution.

- First, equation (3) only involves $c$; re-arranging gives:
$$c = 41 - 29 - 2 - 7 = \boxed{3}$$
- Then, substituting $c = 3$ into equation (1) gives us two equations relating $a$ and $b$:
$$\begin{align} a + 4b &= 29 \\ a + b &= 14 \end{align}$$
- If we subtract equation (5) _from_ equation (4), we have:
$$3b = 15 \implies b = \boxed{5}$$
- Substituting $b = 5$ into $a + b = 14$ gives:
$$a = 14 - 5 = \boxed{9}$$

So, $a = 9$, $b = 5$, and $c = 3$, meaning that:

- the number of values in `ports["date"]` equal to `"2015-11-26"` is 9,
- the number of values in `ports["date"]` equal to `"2015-11-27"` is 5, and
- the number of values in `ports["date"]` equal to `"2015-11-28"` is 3.
