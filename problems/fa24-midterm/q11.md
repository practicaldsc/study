Suppose we define `soup` to be a BeautifulSoup object that is
instantiated using the HTML document below. (To save space, we've
omitted the tags `<html>` and `</html>`.)

```html
<title>Aalborg Airport Customer Reviews - SKYTRAX</title>
<a href="https://www.airlinequality.com" rel="nofollow">
    <img src="https://www.airlinequality.com/images/skytrax.svg" alt="SKYTRAX">
</a>
<div class="skytrax-ratings">
    <table class="review-ratings">
        <tr>
            <td class="terminal-cleanliness">Terminal Cleanliness</td>
            <td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="food-beverages">Food Beverages</td>
            <td>9</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="airport-staff">SKYTRAX Staff</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>
```

In parts 1 and 2, fill in the blanks so that each expression
evaluates to `"SKYTRAX"`.

```python
soup.__(i)__("alt")
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 

```python
    soup.find("img").get("alt")
```

The existing `"alt"` argument tells us that we're looking to extract the `alt` attribute's value from this tag:

```html
<img src="https://www.airlinequality.com/images/skytrax.svg" alt="SKYTRAX">
```

The tag containing this attribute is the very first `img` tag in the document, so `soup.find("img")` will navigate to this tag. To access the value of this tag's `img` attribute, we use `.get("alt")` on the tag, so putting it all together, we have `soup.find("img").get("alt")`.

```python
soup.find("td", __(i)__).text.__(ii)__
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:

```python
    soup.find("td", class_="airport-staff").text.split()[0]
```

or

```python
    soup.find("td", attrs={"class": "airport-staff"}).text[:7]
```

or some combination.

Here, we're told the information we're looking for must be in some `td` tag. There's only one `td` tag that contains `"SKYTRAX"` anywhere, and it's this one:

```html
<td class="airport-staff">SKYTRAX Staff</td>
```

To navigate to this `td` tag specifically, we can ask for a `td` tag whose `class` attribute is `"airport-staff"`. Two ways to do that are:

- `soup.find("td", class_="airport-staff")`
- `soup.find("td", attrs={"class": "airport-staff"})`

Once we've navigated to that tag, its `text` attribute evaluates to `"SKYTRAX Staff"` (the `text` attribute of a tag gives us back all of the text between `<tag>` and `</tag>`). Then, it's a matter of extracting `"SKYTRAX"` from `"SKYTRAX Staff"`, which can either be done by:

- Splitting the string and extracting the first element, which yields `soup.find("td", class_="airport-staff").text.split()[0]`, or
- Slicing just the first 7 characters, which yields `soup.find("td", class_="airport-staff").text[:7]`.

Fill in the blanks so that `avg_rating` evaluates to the mean of the
three ratings in the document above. (In the document, the three ratings
are 4, 9, and 3, but you **shouldn't** hard-code these values.)

```python
texts = [tag.text for tag in soup.find_all("td")]
avg_rating = np.mean([__(i)__ for j in range(__(ii)__)])
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:

```python
    avg_rating = np.mean([int(texts[j]) for j in range(1, 6, 2)])
```

`texts` evaluates to a list containing the text between each `td` tag, all as strings. Here, that would be:

```python
texts = ["Terminal Cleanliness", "4", "Food Beverages", "9", "SKYTRAX Staff", "3"]
```

The purpose of the list comprehension in the second line, `[__(i)__ for j in range(__(ii)__)]`, is to extract out just the numbers from this list. 

- The numbers are at positions 1, 3, and 5, and `range(1, 6, 2)` evaluates to a list (technically, a range object) with the values `[1, 3, 5]`, so iterating over `range(1, 6, 2)` will allow us to access the positions of each number.
- So then, `[j for j in range(1, 6, 2)]` gives us `[1, 3, 5]`, and `[texts[j] for j in range(1, 6, 2)]` gives us `["4", "9", "3"]`.
- We can't take the mean of a list of strings, so we also need to convert each `texts[j]` value either to an int or float. `int(texts[j])` does this for us. Putting all steps together gives us:

```python
[int(texts[j]) for j in range(1, 6, 2)]
```

Note that a common incorrect answer was:

```python
[texts[j].astype(int) for j in range(1, 6, 2)]
```

But, `astype` is a Series method, meaning that whatever comes before `.astype(int)` must be a Series, and each individual `texts[j]` value is a single string, not a Series of strings.
