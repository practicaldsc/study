**Select all** visualization techniques we *could* use to visualize the
distribution of `"overall"` ratings, separately for Delta Air Lines and
United Airlines. At least one answer is correct.

[ ] side-by-side box plots
[ ] side-by-side bar charts
[ ] a scatter plot
[ ] a pie chart
[ ] overlaid histograms

**Answer**: side-by-side box plots, side-by-side bar charts, overlaid histograms

`"overall"` ratings are a numerical feature type, and we've learned to visualize the distribution of numerical features using box plots and histograms.

So, a side-by-side box plot, with one box for Delta Air Lines and one box for United Airlines, would do the job:

<center>
<img src="../assets/images/fa24-midterm/q5-box.png" width=500>
</center>

An overlaid histogram would do the job, too: one histogram figure for Delta, one for United.

<center>
<img src="../assets/images/fa24-midterm/q5-hist.png" width=500>
</center>

But, there's a third possibility! Since `"overall"` ratings are some integer between 0 and 10, we can also use a bar chart to describe them. While we didn't talk about such plots in class explicitly, a similar one is provided to you in the exam at the start of Problem 4! There, we show the distribution of a discrete, numerical feature using a bar chart:

<center>
<img src="../assets/images/fa24-midterm/reviews-per-author.png" width=500>
</center>

We can do the same thing here, with one bar chart for Delta and one for United, overlaid:

<center>
<img src="../assets/images/fa24-midterm/q5-bar.png" width=500>
</center>

<average>82</average>
