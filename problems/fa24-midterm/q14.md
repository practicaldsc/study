The following bag of words matrix represents the frequencies of various
words across four reviews. Assume, just for this question, that the only
five words that appear in any review are the columns of this matrix, and
**all calculations use a base-2 logarithm**.

The matrix has three unknown **integer** values, $A$, $B$, and $C$.
However, we're given that:

-   The TF-IDF of `"movies"` in Review 0 is $\frac{5}{4}$.
-   The TF-IDF of `"landing"` in Review 2 is $\frac{1}{5}$.
-   The cosine similarity between the bag of words vectors for Reviews 1
    and 2 is $\frac{16}{21}$.

**Answer**: 10.

The information we need to answer this part comes from the first bullet point:

> The TF-IDF of `"movies"` in Review 0 is $\frac{5}{4}$.

Recall, the TF-IDF of `"movies"` in Review 0 is:

$$\begin{align*}
\text{tfidf}(\text{``movies"}, \text{Review 0}) &= \text{tf}(\text{``movies"}, \text{Review 0}) \cdot \text{idf}(\text{``movies"}) \\
&= \frac{ \text{number of occurrences of ``movies" in Review 0}}{\text{total number of terms in Review 0}} 
\cdot \log_2 \left( \frac{\text{total number of reviews}}{\text{number of reviews in which ``movies" appears}} \right)
\end{align*}$$

Here, we have:

- The number of occurrences of `"movies"` in Review 0 is $A$.
- The total number of terms in Review 0 is $2 + 1 + 3 + 0 + A = 6 + A$.
- The total number of reviews is 4.
- The number of reviews in which`"movies"` occurs is 1 â€“ it only occurs in Review 0.
- The TF-IDF of `"movies"` in Review 0 is, as the question tells us, $\frac{5}{4}$.

Putting all of this together, we have:

$$\begin{align*}\frac{5}{4} &= \frac{A}{6+A} \cdot \underbrace{\log_2\left(\frac{4}{1}\right)}_{\text{this is } 2\text{, because }2^2 = 4} \\ \frac{5}{4} &= \frac{A}{6+A} \cdot 2 \\ \frac{5}{8} &= \frac{A}{6+A} \\ 5(6+A) &= 8A \\ 30 + 5A &= 8A \\ 30 &= 3A \\ A &= \boxed{10} \end{align*}$$

**Answer**: 3.

The information we need to answer this part comes from the last bullet point:

> The cosine similarity between the bag of words vectors for Reviews 1 and 2 is $\frac{16}{21}$.

Recall, the cosine similarity between two vectors $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ is:

$$\text{cosine similarity}(\vec u, \vec v) = \frac{\vec u \cdot \vec v}{\lVert \vec u \rVert \lVert \vec v \rVert}$$

Here, let $\vec{r_1}$ be the row vector for Review 1 and let $\vec r_2$ be the row vector for Review 2.

- $\vec r_1 \cdot \vec r_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 6 \\ B \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 8 \\ 0 \\ 8 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = 6 \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot 8 = 48 + 16 = 64$.

- $\lVert \vec r_1 \rVert = \sqrt{0^2 + 6^2 + B^2 + 2^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{B^2 + 40}$.
- $\lVert \vec r_2 \rVert = \sqrt{4^2 + 8^2 + 0^2 + 8^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{16 + 64 + 64} = \sqrt{144} = 12$.

So, we have:

$$\begin{align*} \text{cosine similarity}(\vec r_1, \vec r_2) &= \frac{\vec r_1 \cdot \vec r_2}{\lVert \vec r_1 \rVert \lVert \vec r_2 \rVert} \\ \frac{16}{21} &= \frac{64}{12\sqrt{B^2 + 40}} \\ \frac{64}{84} &= \frac{64}{12\sqrt{B^2 + 40}} \\ 84 &= 12 \sqrt{B^2 + 40} \\ 7 &= \sqrt{B^2 + 40} \\ 49 &= B^2 + 40 \\ 9 &= B^2 \\ B = \boxed{3} \end{align*}$$

**Answer**: 0.

The information we need to answer this part comes from the second bullet point:

> The TF-IDF of `"landing"` in Review 2 is $\frac{1}{5}$.

As in part 1, we'll look at the formula for the TF-IDF:

$$\text{tfidf}(\text{``landing"}, \text{Review 0}) = \frac{ \text{number of occurrences of ``landing" in Review 2}}{\text{total number of terms in Review 2}} 
\cdot \log_2 \left( \frac{\text{total number of reviews}}{\text{number of reviews in which ``landing" appears}} \right)$$

Here:

- The number of occurrences of `"landing"` in Review 2 is 4.
- The total number of terms in Review 2 is $4 + 8 + 0 + 8 + 0 = 20$.
- The total number of reviews is 4.
- The number of reviews in which `"landing"` appears is either 2, if $C = 0$, or 3, if $C > 0$.

Putting together what we know, we have:

$$\frac{1}{5} = \frac{5}{20} \cdot \log_2 \left( \frac{4}{\text{number of reviews in which ``landing" appears}} \right)$$

Note that $\frac{5}{20} = \frac{1}{4}$, so:

$$\frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{5} \cdot \log_2 \left( \frac{4}{\text{number of reviews in which ``landing" appears}} \right)$$

In order for the above to be true, we must have that:

$$\log_2 \left( \frac{4}{\text{number of reviews in which ``landing" appears}} \right) = 1 \implies \left( \frac{4}{\text{number of reviews in which ``landing" appears}} \right) = 2$$

This gives us that:

$$\text{number of reviews in which ``landing" appears} = 2$$

So, it must be the case that $C = \boxed{0}$, because there are already two reviews in which `"landing"` appears (Reviews 0 and 2), and if $C > 0$, then `"landing"` would be in three reviews, violating this constraint.
