Consider the string `thoughts`, defined below:

```python
thoughts = """Brought my Sony A5000 for my trip
                the Airbus A220v300's bathroom has a window
                My favorite jet is the B737-900ER flew it like x 239
                all stan the queen B747, 120% the B333st
                I like the chonky A380
                but I love the A350"""
```

There are exactly 5 valid **plane codes** in `thoughts`: `"A220"`,
`"B737"`, `"B747"`, `"A380"`, and `"A350"`. For each regular expression
`exp` below,

-   specify the number of valid plane codes that the expression
    `re.findall(exp, thoughts)` extracts in their entirety, and
-   specify the number of **other, invalid** strings that
    `re.findall(exp, thoughts)` also extracts.

The first example has been done for you.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

```python
exp = r"B\d{3}"
```

- How many valid plane codes were extracted? $\boxed{2}$
- How many invalid strings were extracted? $\boxed{1}$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

Even though the answer was already provided for you, we've illustrated it here:

The regular expression says, match any sequence of characters with a `"B"` followed by any three digits. This correctly captures `"B737"` and `"B747"`, but incorrectly captures `"B333"` in line 4, which is not a valid plane code.

- How many valid plane codes were extracted?
- How many invalid strings were extracted?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

- How many valid plane codes were extracted? **5**.
- How many invalid strings were extracted? **2**.

The regular expression says, match any sequence of characters with an `"A"` or `"B"` followed by any three digits. This correctly captures all 5 plane codes, but also matches `"A500"` in line 1 and `"B333"` in line 4.

- How many valid plane codes were extracted?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:

- How many valid plane codes were extracted? **5**.
- How many invalid strings were extracted? **1**.

This regular expression says, match any sequence that either looks like:

- The character `"A"`, followed by any two digits, followed by a `"0"`, or
- The character `"B"`, followed by a `"7"`, followed by any digit, followed by another `"7"`.

This correctly captures all 5 plane codes, but also matches `"A500"`. Unlike the previous regular expression, it doesn't match `"B333"`.

- How many valid plane codes were extracted?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:

- How many valid plane codes were extracted? **5**.
- How many invalid strings were extracted? **0**.

This regular expression says, match any sequence that looks like:

- The character `"A"`, followed by either a `"2"` or a `"3"`, followed by any digit, followed by a `"0"`, or
- The character `"B"`, followed by a `"7"`, followed by any digit, followed by another `"7"`.

This correctly captures all 5 plane codes, and nothing else! `"B333"` still isn't matched, and `"A500"` isn't matched either, because we've required that the digit right after `"A"` must either be `"2"` or `"3"`, disqualifying the `"5"` in `"A500"`.

- How many valid plane codes were extracted?
- How many invalid strings were extracted?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:

- How many valid plane codes were extracted? **2**.
- How many invalid strings were extracted? **0**.

The difference between this regular expression and the last one is the anchor at the end, `$`. This requires the pattern being matched to be at the end of a line. While are 5 valid plane codes in `thoughts`, only two are at the end of their respective lines: `"A380"` in line 5 and `"A350"` in line 6. So, those are the only two plane codes that are matched.

Many students thought just 1 valid plane code would be extracted, as they thought `$` meant "end of string" instead of "end of line".
