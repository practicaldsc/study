Suppose we define `n = reviews.shape[0]`.

In each of the four parts of this question, we provide an expression
that evaluates to a new DataFrame. Depending on the expression, the new
DataFrame:

-   May or may not have the same number of rows as `reviews`.
-   May have some rows from `reviews` appear multiple times (i.e. may
    have duplicated rows). Note that `reviews` itself **does not** have
    any duplicated rows.
-   May have rows that appear in a different order than they appeared in
    `reviews`.

For example, if `df` is on the left, the DataFrame on the right has the
same number of rows as `df`, has some duplicated rows (row 1 appears
twice), and has the same row order as `df` (all row 0s before row 1s,
all row 1s before row 2s, etc.).

from each of the following expressions.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:

(i) Same number of rows as `reviews`? **No**.
(ii) Possibility of duplicated rows? **No**.
(iii) Row order guaranteed to be the same as `reviews`? **Yes**.

Here, `np.random.choice([True, False], size=n, replace=True)` evaluates to an array of `True`s and `False`s with the same length as `reviews`. For instance, it may evaluate to:

```python
np.array([True, False, False, True, True, False, True, False, ...., False])
```

When passing this array into `reviews.loc`, it is used as a Boolean mask, the same way that Boolean Series are. For example, we write `reviews.loc[reviews["author"] == "Santa Ono"]` – or `reviews[reviews["author"] == "Santa Ono"]` for short – we're asking to keep all the rows when `reviews["author"] == "Santa Ono"` (a Boolean Series) contains `True` and exclude all of the rows when that Boolean Series contains `False`.

In the above example, we're saying keep row 0, exclude rows 1 and 2, keep rows 3 and 4, exclude row 5, and so on. In this scheme:

- (i). Since there will (almost certainly) be some `False`s in the resulting array, we will exclude at least some of the rows in `reviews`, so the result will almost certainly **not have** the same number of rows as `reviews`.
- (ii). We can't include the same row multiple times – we either include or exclude each row – so there's **no possibility of duplicated rows**.
- (iii). We can't change the order in which rows appear, since in effect we're just removing a subset of rows but doing no other shuffling. So, the row order **is guaranteed** to be the same as in `reviews`.

```python
reviews.loc[np.random.permutation(np.arange(n))]

(i) Same number of rows as `reviews`? <input type="radio" disabled="" /> Yes <input type="radio" disabled="" /> No

(ii) Possibility of duplicated rows? <input type="radio" disabled="" /> Yes <input type="radio" disabled="" /> No

(iii) Row order guaranteed to be the same as `reviews`? <input type="radio" disabled="" /> Yes <input type="radio" disabled="" /> No

# BEGIN SOLUTION

(i) Same number of rows as `reviews`? **Yes**.
(ii) Possibility of duplicated rows? **No**.
(iii) Row order guaranteed to be the same as `reviews`? **No**.

`np.arange(n)` evaluates to the array:

```python
np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n - 2, n - 1])
```

where, again, `n` is the length of `reviews`. `np.random.permutation` shuffles a sequence, without removing or adding any extra elements, so `np.random.permutation(np.arange(n))` is an array with the integers between `0` in `n - 1` in a random order.

Separately, as we see in the DataFrame preview provided at the start of the exam, the index of `reviews` is **0**, **1**, **2**, **3**, etc. When passing a sequence of index values as the first argument to `reviews.loc`, `pandas` will return a DataFrame with just the index values you asked for.

For example, `reviews.loc[[19, 1, 3, 18]]` evaluates to a DataFrame with 4 rows, specifically, the rows with index values **19**, **1**, **3**, and **18** from `reviews`. If the index of `reviews` **wasn't** made up of integers, then `reviews.loc[[19, 1, 3, 18]]` would error (and we'd need to use `reviews.iloc`, which uses integer positions, instead).

Putting this all together, `reviews.loc[np.random.permutation(np.arange(n))]` will produce a new DataFrame that results from **shuffling** all of the rows in `reviews`. If `np.random.permutation(np.arange(n))` evalutes to `np.array([235, 11, 4, 953, 23, 1, 355, ...])`, `reviews.loc[np.random.permutation(np.arange(n))]` will first have row **235** from `reviews`, then row **11**, and so on.

So, the resulting DataFrame will have **the same number of rows** as `reviews`, and **not have any duplicated rows**, but **have a different row order** than `reviews` in all likelihood.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

(i) Same number of rows as `reviews`? **Yes**.
(ii) Possibility of duplicated rows? **Yes**.
(iii) Row order guaranteed to be the same as `reviews`? **No**.

The expression `np.random.choice(np.arange(n), size=n, replace=True)` selects `n` elements **with replacement** from `np.arange(n)`, and returns the results in an array. This array could look like, for example:

```python
np.array([235, 15, 3, 940, 15, ...])
```

The resulting array will have `n` elements, but could have duplicated values (**15** in the example above), and also could be sorted differently than `reviews`. So, the DataFrame that results from `reviews.loc[np.random.choice(np.arange(n), size=n, replace=True)]` will have **the same number of rows** as `reviews`, but **could have duplicated values**, and very well could **have a different row order** than `reviews`.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

(i) Same number of rows as `reviews`? **Yes**.
(ii) Possibility of duplicated rows? **No**.
(iii) Row order guaranteed to be the same as `reviews`? **No**.

The expression `np.random.choice(np.arange(n), size=n, replace=False)` selects `n` elements **without replacement** from `np.arange(n)`, and returns the results in an array.

Let's consider what it means to select `n` items without replacement from a collection of `n` items labeled `0`, `1`, `2`, ..., `n-1`. For example, let `n = 5`. Then, selecting 5 elements **without replacement** from `np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])` could look like:

- Select one element randomly, say, `2`. Now there are 4 items left, `np.array([0, 1, 3, 4])`. 
- Let's pick `3`. Now we have 3 items left, `np.array([0, 1, 4])`.
- Let's pick `1`. Now we have 2 items left, `np.array([0, 4])`.
- Let's pick `4`. Now we have 1 item left, `np.array([0])`.
- Let's pick `0`. We're done!
- So, the 5 items we picked, in order, are `np.array([2, 3, 1, 4, 0])`.

`np.array([2, 3, 1, 4, 0])` is just a **permutation** of `np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])`!

More generally, `np.random.choice(np.arange(n), size=n, replace=False)` behaves identically to `np.random.permutation(np.arange(n))`, so our answer to this part should be the same as our answer to part 2 of this question. That is, `reviews.loc[np.random.choice(np.arange(n), size=n, replace=False)]` produces a DataFrame that has **the same number of rows** as `reviews`, and **does not have any duplicated rows**, but **has a different row order** than `reviews` in all likelihood.
