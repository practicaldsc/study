All airports have IATA codes, which are strings of three uppercase
letters that uniquely identify the airport. For example, Detroit's IATA
code is `"DTW"`. Many of the entries in the `"content"` column of
`reviews` use IATA codes to describe the route flown.

We define a **route string** as being a pair of IATA codes separated by
`"-"` or `" to "` (pay close attention to the spacing). For example, in
`test_review` there are two route strings, `"YWG-LHR"` and
`"EDI to YWG"`:

```python
test_review = """I recently traveled YWG-LHR and returned home from 
                    EDI to YWG with AC Rouge. I must say I was
                    pleasantly surprised with how well the trip went
                    in both directions, but I'm glad I didn't have to
                    transit in ORD."""
```

Write a regular expression that matches valid
route strings.

Here, we need to match all sequences with:

- Three uppercase letters, matched by `[A-Z]{3}`, followed by
- Either `" to "` or `"-"`, matched by `( to |-)`, followed by
- Three more uppercase letters, matched by `[A-Z]{3}`.

Some refreshers:

- The `[A-Z]` character class matches any uppercase letter.
- {3} says "repeat the previous character 3 times".
- In `( to |-)`, the spaces and `-` are literals, and `|` is the "or" operator. Parentheses are needed so that the "or" operation only applies to ` to ` and `-`, not everything before and after the `|`.
