Consider the DataFrame `imp`, shown in its entirety below.

As in the previous question, we define the **robust mean** of a
collection of values to be the mean of all values, once the largest and
smallest values are removed. For example, the robust mean of
$2, 2, 3, 7, 12$ is $\frac{2+3+7}{3} = 4$.

Suppose we use **robust mean imputation, conditional on `"cabin"`** to
fill in the missing values in the `"overall"` column. In doing so, what
are the missing values in the `"overall"` column filled in with? Give
your answers as **numbers**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:

- Missing value in row `9`: 6 (or 6.0)
- Missing value in row `10`: 7 (or 7.0)

To perform **robust mean** imputation, conditional on `"cabin"`, we must fill each missing `"overall"` value with the robust mean of the observed `"overall"` values with the same `"cabin"` as the missing value. So:

- The missing value in row `9` has a `"cabin"` of Business. The observed `"overall"` values for Business are 7, 6, and 2. The robust mean of 7, 6, and 2 is just 6, since when you remove the min (2) and max (7) you're left with just a single value, 6, and the mean of a single value is that one value. So, we fill in the missing value in row `9` with **6**.
- The missing value in row `10` has a `"cabin"` of Premium Economy. The observed `"overall"` values for Premium Economy are 5, 6, 9, and 8, and the robust mean of these values is $\frac{6 + 8}{2} = 7$, which is the mean once the min (5) and max (9) are removed. So, we fill in the missing value in row `10` with **7**.

Suppose `imp` represents the DataFrame above, with 2 missing values, and
`filled` represents the DataFrame that results from imputing the missing
values in `imp` in the way described in the previous part. In the
following code block, what is the value of `comp`?

```python
  old_means = imp.groupby("cabin")["overall"].mean()
  comp = old_means == filled.groupby("cabin")["overall"].mean()
```

( ) `True`
( ) `False`                                 
( ) The Series `[True, True, True]`   
( ) The Series `[False, False, False]`     
( ) The Series `[True, True, False]`     
( ) The Series `[True, False, True]`       
( ) The Series `[False, True, True]`  
( ) The Series `[False, False, True]`       
( ) The Series `[False, True, False]`  
( ) The Series `[True, False, False]`      

Hint: When grouping, the index is automatically sorted in ascending
order.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: The Series `[False, True, True]`

`old_means` is a Series containing the mean `"overall"` score of each `"airline"`, before we fill in any missing values (i.e. with missing values ignored), and `filled.groupby("cabin")["overall"].mean()` is a Series containing the mean `"overall"` score of each `"airline"` post-imputation. The index of both of these Series is `["Business", "First", "Premium Economy"]`, since when grouping and aggregating, the index is set to the unique values in the grouped-on column (`"cabin"`, here) in ascending order.

So, this question boils down to checking whether the means of each group changed because of the imputation we did.

- Business:
  - Mean before imputation: $\frac{7 + 6 + 2}{3} = 5$.
  - Mean after imputation: $\frac{7 + 6 + 2 + 6}{4} = 5.25$.
  - Different!
- First: No missing values, so we didn't have to impute anything, so nothing changed!
- Premium Economy:
  - Mean before imputation: $\frac{5 + 6 + 9 + 8}{4} = 7$.
  - Mean after imputation: $\frac{5 + 6 + 9 + 8 + 7}{5} = 7$.
  - Same! Note that because the robust mean is equal to the regular mean, in effect, we imputed the missing value with the mean of the observed values, which we know will not change the mean. (Add a bunch of average values to a dataset, and the average doesn't change!)

So, the Business mean changed, while the First and Premium Economy means did not change. In the order `["Business", "First", "Premium Economy"]` that we established above, our comparisons are `[False, True, True]`, and so `comp` is a Series of `[False, True, True]`.
