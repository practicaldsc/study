Consider the following SQL query.

```sql
    SELECT author, AVG(overall) AS average_overall FROM reviews
    GROUP BY author
    HAVING AVG(overall) >= 8 AND COUNT(*) >= 5
    ORDER BY average_overall;
```

Now, consider the following four code blocks.

-   Block 1:
```python
    f = lambda x: x["overall"].mean() >= 8 and x.shape[0] >= 5
    pop_auth = (reviews.groupby("author").filter(f)
                        .groupby("author")[["overall"]].mean()
                        .sort_values("overall").reset_index())
```

-   Block 2:
```python
    g = lambda x: x.shape[0] >= 5
    pop_auth = (reviews[reviews["overall"] >= 8]
                .groupby("author").filter(g)
                .groupby("author")[["overall"]].mean()
                .sort_values("overall").reset_index())
```

-   Block 3:
```python
    pop_auth = (reviews["author"].value_counts().reset_index()
                .merge(
                    reviews.groupby("author")[["overall"]].mean().reset_index(), 
                    on="author")
                .pipe(lambda x: x[(x["overall"] >= 8)])
                .sort_values("overall")
                .pipe(lambda r: r[r["count"] >= 5])
                [["author", "overall"]])
```

-   Block 4:
```python
    temp = reviews.groupby("author")["overall"].agg(["count", "mean"])
    pop_auth = (temp[(temp["count"] >= 5) & (temp["mean"] >= 8)]
                .sort_values("mean")
                .reset_index()[["author", "mean"]])
```

Three of the blocks above correctly assign `pop_auth` to a DataFrame
that is equivalent to the table outputted by the SQL query at the top of
the page (ignoring the names of the resulting columns and the values in
the index). One of the options **is incorrect**.

Which block is **incorrect** – that is, which block **does not**
assign `pop_auth` so that it is equivalent to the result of the SQL
query at the top of the page?

( ) Block 1 
( ) Block 2 
( ) Block 3 
( ) Block 4

**Answer**: Block 2

The provided SQL query finds the name and average `"overall"` rating given by all `"author"`s who wrote at least 5 reviews and gave an average `"overall"` rating of at least 8. Blocks 1, 3, and 4 do this.

The issue with Block 2 is that it first **queries** for just the rows where the `"overall"` rating is over 8 before grouping, using `reviews[reviews["overall"] >= 8]`. After this (`pandas`) query, we've totally lost all of the rows with an `"overall"` rating below 8. It's very possible for `"author"`s to have an average `"overall"` rating above 8 but have written _some_ reviews with an `"overall"` rating below 8, which means that the resulting DataFrame in Block 2 could have incorrect average `"overall"` ratings for some `"author"`s. It could even be missing some `"author"`s entirely.

For example, suppose we have two `"author"`s, A and B, who gave out the following `"overall"` ratings:

- A: 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10 (average: 9.166).
- B: 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10 (average: 8.5).

Both A and B meet the criteria to be included in the the output DataFrame – they have written at least 5 reviews and have an average `"overall"` rating of at least 8. But, after querying out all of the rows with an `"overall"` rating under 8, B is reduced to just having the 4 values 8, 9, 10, 10. Since B no longer fits the criteria in `filter(g)`, it won't be included in the output.
