Consider the function `operate`, defined below.

```python
def operate(df):
    df["content"] = df["content"].str.split().str.len()
```

Consider the following six answer choices:

A.  Nothing, because we didn't reassign `reviews` after calling
    `operate(reviews)`.

B.  `reviews["content"]` now contains the number of characters per
    review.

C.  `reviews["content"]` now contains the number of words per review.

D.  We see an error because we're trying to use `.str` methods on an
    invalid column.

E.  We see an error because a column with the name `"content"` already
    exists.

F.  We see an error because we're assuming `df` is a DataFrame but it is
    `None` (null).

All three parts of this question are **independent** from one another;
the code in earlier parts should not influence your answers in later
parts.

```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: C. `reviews["content"]` now contains the number of words per review.

The main premise behind this question is that running `operate(reviews)` makes an in-place modification to `reviews`, because DataFrame objects are **mutable**. So, even though we didn't run `reviews = operate(reviews)`, `reviews` was still updated.

Let's visualize what happens to the Series `reviews["content"]` through the transformation `reviews["content"].str.split().str.len()`:

To summarize:

- If `s` is a Series of strings, `s.str.split()` evaluates to a Series of **lists** resulting from splitting each string in `s` by `" "` (the default argument to `split` is `" "`). These new lists now contain all of the words in the original strings.
- Now, if `t` is a Series of lists, then `t.str.len()` evaluates to a Series of **ints** containing the lengths of the lists in `t`. If each list in `t` contained words, then the ints in `t.str.len()` represent numbers of words.
- So, `reviews["content"].str.split().str.len()` evaluates to a list containing the number of words per review!

**Answer**: D. We see an error because we're trying to use `.str` methods on an invalid column.

As we discussed in the solution above, after running `operate(reviews)`, the DataFrame `reviews` is modified in-place such that its `"content"` column contains the number of words per review. This new `"content"` column is made up of ints.

When we try and call `operate(reviews)` a second time, we'll try to use `.str.split()` on the new `"content"` column, but the new `"content"` column contains ints! Numbers cannot be "split", and `.str` methods in general don't work on Series of numbers, so we'll get an error that results from this mismatch in types.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: F. We see an error because we're assuming `df` is a DataFrame but it is
    `None` (null).

As discussed in the previous two solutions, after calling `operate(reviews)`, `reviews["content"]` now contains the number of words per review. However, the function `operate` itself doesn't have an explicit `return` keyword, which means it returns `None`, the default Python null value. That is, `operate(reviews)` makes an in-place modification, but outputs `None`.

So, when we set `reviews = operate(reviews)`, we're effectively setting `reviews = None`, i.e. setting `reviews` to a null value. So, the second time `operate(reviews)` is called, Python will try to use `None` in place of `df` in the body of `operate`:

```python
def operate(df):
    df["content"] = df["content"].str.split().str.len()
```

But, `None["content"]` is an undefined operation, and we'll get an error to that effect.
