Fill in the blanks so that `santas_airlines` evaluates to an array
containing the **unique** names of the airlines that Santa Ono has
reviewed.

```python
santas_airlines = reviews.loc[__(i)__, __(ii)__].__(iii)__
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:

```python
    santas_airlines = reviews.loc[reviews["author"] == "Santa Ono", "airline"].unique()
```

Conceptually, we need to find a Series containing the names of all of the airlines that Santa Ono has reviewed, and then find the unique values in that Series.

`loc` helps us extract a subset of the rows and columns in a DataFrame. In general, `loc` works as follows:

```
    reviews.loc[<subset of rows>, <subset of columns>]
```

Here:
- We want all of the rows where `reviews["author"]` is equal to `"Santa Ono"`, so we use the expression `reviews["author"] == "Santa Ono"` as the first input to `loc`. (Remember, `reviews["author"] == "Santa Ono"` is a Series of `True`s and `False`s; only the `True` values are kept in the result.)
- We want just the column `"airline"`, so we supply it as a string as the second input to `loc`.

Now, we have a Series with the names of all airlines that Santa Ono has reviewed; calling the `.unique()` method on this Series will give us back an **array** with just the unique values in the Series, which is what we're looking for here.
