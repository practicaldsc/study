Consider the DataFrames `type_pivot`, `clinique`, `fresh`, and `boscia`,
defined below.

```python
    type_pivot = skin.pivot_table(index="Type",
                                  columns="Brand", 
                                  values="Sensitive",
                                  aggfunc=lambda s: s.shape[0] + 1)
                                   
    clinique = skin[skin["Brand"] == "clinique"]
    fresh = skin[skin["Brand"] == "fresh"]
    boscia = skin[skin["Brand"] == "BOSCIA"]
```
Three columns of `type_pivot` are shown below **in their entirety**.

How many rows are in the following DataFrame?

```python
    clinique.merge(fresh, on="Type", how="inner")
```
# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 10

The expression `clinique.merge(fresh, on="Type", how="inner")` performs an **inner join** on the `"Type"` column between the `clinique` and `fresh` DataFrames. An inner join includes only rows where the `"Type"` values are present in both DataFrames.

From the provided `type_pivot` table, we know that  the overlapping `”Type”` values between clinique and fresh are:

  - Face Mask (3.0 for `clinique`, 4.0 for `fresh`)

  - Moisturizer (3.0 for `clinique`, 3.0 for `fresh`)

However, we must notice that the `aggfunc` for our original pivot table is `lambda s: s.shape[0] + 1`. Thus, we know that the values in the pivot table include an additional count of 1 for each group. This means the raw counts are actually:

- Face Mask: 2 rows in `clinique`, 3 rows in `fresh`

- Moisturizer: 2 rows in `clinique`, 2 rows in `fresh`

The inner join will match these rows based on `"Type"`. Since there are 2 rows in `clinique` for both Face Mask and Moisturizer, and 3 and 2 rows in `fresh` respectively, the result will have:

- Face Mask: 2 (from `clinique`) × 3 (from `fresh`) = 6 rows

- Moisturizer: 2 (from `clinique`) × 2 (from `fresh`) = 4 rows

The total number of rows in the resulting DataFrame is $$6 + 4 = 10$$.

How many rows are in the following DataFrame?

```python
    (clinique.merge(fresh, on="Type", how="outer")
             .merge(boscia, on="Type", how="outer"))
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: 31

An **outer join** includes all rows from all DataFrames, filling in missing values (`NaN`) for any `Type` not present in one of them. From the table, the counts are calculated as follows:

Remember that our pivot_table `aggfunc` is calculating `lambda s: s.shape[0] + 1` (so we need to subtract one from the pivot table entry to get the actual number of rows).

- Cleanser: $5 \cdot 1$
  - 5 rows in `clinique`
  - 1 row in `BOSCIA`
- Eye cream: $3 \cdot 1$
  - 3 rows in `clinique`
  - 1 row in `BOSCIA`
- Face Mask: $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3$
  - 2 rows in `clinique`
  - 3 rows in `fresh`
  - 3 rows in `BOSCIA`
- Moisturizer: $2 \cdot 2$
  - 2 rows in `clinique`
  - 2 rows in `fresh`

- Sun protect: 1
  - 1 row in `clinique`
\

Final Calculation:
$$5 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 2 + 1 = 31$$
