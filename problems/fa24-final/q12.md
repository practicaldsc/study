Suppose we fit five different classifiers that predict whether a product
is designed for sensitive skin, given its price and number of
ingredients. In the five decision boundaries below, the gray-shaded
regions represent areas in which the classifier would predict that the
product **is** designed for sensitive skin (i.e. predict class 1).
