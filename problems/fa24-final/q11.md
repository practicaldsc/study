Suppose we want to use LASSO (i.e. minimize mean squared error with
$L_1$ regularization) to fit a linear model that predicts the number of
ingredients in a product given its price and rating.

Let $\lambda$ be a non-negative regularization hyperparameter. Using
cross-validation, we determine the average validation mean squared error
--- which we'll refer to as AVMSE in this question --- for several
different choices of $\lambda$. The results are given below.
