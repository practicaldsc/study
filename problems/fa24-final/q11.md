Suppose we want to use LASSO (i.e. minimize mean squared error with
$L_1$ regularization) to fit a linear model that predicts the number of
ingredients in a product given its price and rating.

Let $\lambda$ be a non-negative regularization hyperparameter. Using
cross-validation, we determine the average validation mean squared error
--- which we'll refer to as AVMSE in this question --- for several
different choices of $\lambda$. The results are given below.

As $\lambda$ increases, what happens to model complexity and model
variance?

( ) Model complexity and model variance both increase.
( ) Model complexity increases while model variance decreases.
( ) Model complexity decreases while model variance increases.
( ) Model complexity and model variance both decrease.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: Model complexity and model variance both decrease.

As $\lambda$ increases, the $L_1$ regularization penalizes the model more heavily for including features, effectively reducing the number of non-zero coefficients in the model. This decreases model complexity. Additionally, by reducing complexity, the model becomes less sensitive to the training data, leading to lower variance.

What does the value $A$ on the graph above correspond to?

( ) The AVMSE of the $\lambda$ we'd choose to use to train a model.
( ) The AVMSE of an unregularized multiple linear regression model.
( ) The AVMSE of the constant model.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: The AVMSE of an unregularized multiple linear regression model.

Point $A$ represents the case where $\lambda = 0$, meaning no regularization is applied. This corresponds to an unregularized multiple linear regression model.

What does the value $B$ on the graph above correspond to?

( ) The AVMSE of the $\lambda$ we'd choose to use to train a model.
( ) The AVMSE of an unregularized multiple linear regression model.
( ) The AVMSE of the constant model.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: The AVMSE of the $\lambda$ we'd choose to use to train a model.

Point $B$ is the minimum point on the graph, indicating the optimal $\lambda$ value that minimizes the AVMSE. This is the $\lambda$ weâ€™d choose to train the model.

What does the value $C$ on the graph above correspond to?

( ) The AVMSE of the $\lambda$ we'd choose to use to train a model.
( ) The AVMSE of an unregularized multiple linear regression model.
( ) The AVMSE of the constant model.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: The AVMSE of the constant model.

Point $C$ represents the AVMSE when $\lambda$ is very large, effectively forcing all coefficients to zero. This corresponds to the constant model.
