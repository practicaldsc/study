Suppose we want to fit a multiple linear regression model (using squared
loss) that predicts the number of ingredients in a product given its
price and various other information.

From the Data Overview page, we know that there are **6** different
**types** of products. Assume in this question that there are **20**
different product **brands**. Consider the models defined in the table
below.

         **Model Name**         **Intercept**   **Price**   **Type**   **Brand**
  ---------------------------- --------------- ----------- ---------- -----------
          **Model A**                Yes           Yes         No     
   **without** `drop="first"`                                         
          **Model B**                Yes           Yes         No         No
          **Model C**                Yes           Yes                
   **without** `drop="first"`        No                               
          **Model D**                No            Yes                
    **with** `drop="first"`                                           
    **with** `drop="first"`                                           
          **Model E**                No            Yes                
    **with** `drop="first"`                                           
   **without** `drop="first"`                                         

For instance, Model A above includes an intercept term, price as a
feature, one hot encodes brand names, and doesn't use `drop="first"` as
an argument to `OneHotEncoder` in `sklearn`.

In parts (a) through (c), you are given a model. For each model
provided, state the **number** of columns and the rank (i.e. number of
linearly independent columns) of the design matrix, $X$. Some of part
(a) is already done for you as an example.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

**Model A**

Number of columns in $X$: Rank of $X$:

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

**Model B**

Number of columns in $X$: Rank of $X$:

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

**Model C**

Number of columns in $X$: Rank of $X$:

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

**Model D**

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

**Model E**

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following models are **NOT guaranteed** to have residuals
that sum to 0?

*Hint: Remember, the residuals of a fit model are the differences
between actual and predicted $y$-values, among the data points in the
training set.*

[ ] Model A

[ ] Model B

[ ] Model C

[ ] Model D

[ ] Model E
