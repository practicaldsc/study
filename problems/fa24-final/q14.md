Suppose, again, that we fit a logistic regression model that predicts
whether a product is designed for sensitive skin. We're deciding between
three thresholds, $A$, $B$, and $C$, all of which are real numbers
between 0 and 1 (inclusive). If a product's predicted probability of
being designed for sensitive skin is above our chosen threshold, we
predict they belong to class 1 (yes); otherwise, we predict class 0
(no).

The confusion matrices of our model on the test set for all three
thresholds are shown below.

$$\begin{array}{ccc}
\textbf{$A$} & \textbf{$B$} & \textbf{$C$} \\
\begin{array}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
& \text{Pred.} \: 0 & \text{Pred.} \: 1 \\
\hline
\text{Actually} \: 0 & 40 & 5 \\
\hline
\text{Actually} \: 1 & 35 & 35 \\
\hline
\end{array}
&
\begin{array}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
& \text{Pred.} \: 0 & \text{Pred.} \: 1 \\
\hline
\text{Actually} \: 0 & 5 & 40 \\
\hline
\text{Actually} \: 1 & 10 & ??? \\

\end{array}

\begin{array}{|l|c|c|}

\hline
\text{Actually} \: 0 & 10 & 35 \\

\text{Actually} \: 1 & 30 & 40 \\

Suppose we choose threshold $A$, i.e. the **leftmost** confusion matrix.
What is the precision of the resulting predictions? Give your answer as
an **unsimplified fraction**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: $\frac{35}{40}$ 

The precision of a binary classification model is calculated as:

$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives (TP)}}{\text{True Positives (TP)} + \text{False Positives (FP)}}
$$

From the confusion matrix for threshold $A$:

$$
\begin{array}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
& \text{Pred.} \: 0 & \text{Pred.} \: 1 \\
\hline
\text{Actually} \: 0 & 40 & 5 \\
\hline
\text{Actually} \: 1 & 35 & 35 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

The number of true positives (TP) is $35$, and the number of false positives (FP) is $5$. Substituting into the formula:

$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{35}{35 + 5} = \frac{35}{40}
$$

What is the missing value (???) in the confusion matrix for threshold
$B$? Give your answer as an **integer**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: $60$

From the confusion matrix for threshold $B$:

$$
\begin{array}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
& \text{Pred.} \: 0 & \text{Pred.} \: 1 \\
\hline
\text{Actually} \: 0 & 5 & 40 \\
\hline
\text{Actually} \: 1 & 10 & ??? \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

The sum of all entries in a confusion matrix must equal the total number of samples. For thresholds $A$ and $C$, the total number of samples is:

$$
40 + 5 + 35 + 35 = 115
$$

Using this total, for threshold $B$, the entries provided are:

$$
5  + 40  + 10  + ??? = 115
$$

Solving for the missing value (???):

$$
115 - (5 + 40 + 10) = 60
$$

Thus, the missing value for threshold $B$ is:

$$
60
$$

Using the information in the three confusion matrices, arrange the
thresholds from **largest to smallest**. Remember that
$0 \leq A, B, C \leq 1$.

( ) $A$ $>$ $B$ $>$ $C$
( ) $A$ $>$ $C$ $>$ $B$
( ) $B$ $>$ $A$ $>$ $C$
( ) $B$ $>$ $C$ $>$ $A$
( ) $C$ $>$ $A$ $>$ $B$
( ) $C$ $>$ $B$ $>$ $A$

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: $A > C > B$

Thresholds can be arranged based on their strictness. The higher a modelâ€™s threshold is, the fewer positive predictions and the more negative predictions it has. Model A made 40 negative predictions, Model B made 5 negative predictions and  Model C made 10 negative predictions. Sorting these in descending order with more negative predictions implying a stricter threshold we get - 

$$
A > C > B
$$

Remember that in our classification problem, class 1 means the product
**is** designed for sensitive skin, and class 0 means the product **is
not** designed for sensitive skin. In one or two English sentences,
explain which is **worse** in this context and **why**: a false positive
or a false negative.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: False positive

A false positive is worse, as it would mean we predict a product is safe when it isn't; someone with sensitive skin may use it and it could harm them.
