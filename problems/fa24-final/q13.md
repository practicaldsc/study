Suppose we fit a logistic regression model that predicts whether a
product is designed for sensitive skin, given its price, $x^{(1)}$,
number of ingredients, $x^{(2)}$, and rating, $x^{(3)}$. After
minimizing average cross-entropy loss, the optimal parameter vector is
as follows:

$$\vec{w}^* = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 / 5 \\ - 3 / 5 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$

In other words, the intercept term is $-1$, the coefficient on price is
$\frac{1}{5}$, the coefficient on the number of ingredients is
$-\frac{3}{5}$, and the coefficient on rating is $0$.

Consider the following four products:

-   **Wolfcare**: Costs \$15, made of 20 ingredients, 4.5 rating

-   **Go Blue Glow**: Costs \$25, made of 5 ingredients, 4.9 rating

-   **DataSPF**: Costs \$50, made of 15 ingredients, 3.6 rating

-   **Maize Mist**: Free, made of 1 ingredient, 5.0 rating

Which of the following products have a predicted probability of being
designed for sensitive skin of **at least 0.5 (50%)**? For each product,
select Yes or No and justify your answer.
