Suppose we fit a logistic regression model that predicts whether a
product is designed for sensitive skin, given its price, $x^{(1)}$,
number of ingredients, $x^{(2)}$, and rating, $x^{(3)}$. After
minimizing average cross-entropy loss, the optimal parameter vector is
as follows:

$$\vec{w}^* = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 / 5 \\ - 3 / 5 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$

In other words, the intercept term is $-1$, the coefficient on price is
$\frac{1}{5}$, the coefficient on the number of ingredients is
$-\frac{3}{5}$, and the coefficient on rating is $0$.

Consider the following four products:

-   **Wolfcare**: Costs \$15, made of 20 ingredients, 4.5 rating

-   **Go Blue Glow**: Costs \$25, made of 5 ingredients, 4.9 rating

-   **DataSPF**: Costs \$50, made of 15 ingredients, 3.6 rating

-   **Maize Mist**: Free, made of 1 ingredient, 5.0 rating

Which of the following products have a predicted probability of being
designed for sensitive skin of **at least 0.5 (50%)**? For each product,
select Yes or No and justify your answer.



**Wolfcare:**

# BEGIN SOLUTION

In order to solve this problem, we need to use the sigmoid function to cast our result into a probability between 0-1. As a reminder, the sigmoid function $\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$ trends towards 0 when the input becomes more negative, and towards 1 as the input becomes a higher positive.

**Wolfcare**:

$$
z = -1 + \frac{1}{5}(15) - \frac{3}{5}(20) + 0 = -1 + 3 - 12 = -10
$$
$$
P = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(-10)}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{10}} \approx 0
$$

**Decision: No**, as $P < 0.5$

**Go Blue Glow**:

$$
z = -1 + \frac{1}{5}(25) - \frac{3}{5}(5) + 0 = -1 + 5 - 3 = 1
$$
$$
P = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-1}} \approx \frac{1}{1 + 0.3679} \approx 0.73
$$

**Decision: Yes**, as $P \geq 0.5$.

**DataSPF**:

$$
z = -1 + \frac{1}{5}(50) - \frac{3}{5}(15) + 0 = -1 + 10 - 9 = 0
$$
$$
P = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-0}} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
$$

**Decision: Yes**, as $P \geq 0.5$.

**Maize Mist**:
$$
z = -1 + \frac{1}{5}(0) - \frac{3}{5}(1) + 0 = -1 - 0.6 = -1.6
$$
$$
P = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(-1.6)}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{1.6}} \approx \frac{1}{1 + 4.953} \approx 0.17
$$
**Decision: No**, as $P < 0.5$
