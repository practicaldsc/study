Suppose we want to fit a simple linear regression model (using squared
loss) that predicts the number of ingredients in a product given its
price. We're given that:

-   The average cost of a product in our dataset is \$40, i.e.
    $\bar x = 40$.

-   The average number of ingredients in a product in our dataset is 15,
    i.e. $\bar y = 15$.

The intercept and slope of the regression line are $w_0^* = 11$ and
$w_1^* = \frac{1}{10}$, respectively.

Suppose Victors' Veil (a skincare product) costs \$40 and has 11
ingredients. What is the squared loss of our model's predicted number of
ingredients for Victors' Veil? Give your answer as a **number**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: $16$

Using the equation of the regression model we have seen in class:  
$$ H(x) = w_0^* + w_1^* x $$  

Substitute $w_0^* = 11$, $w_1^* = \frac{1}{10}$, and $x = 40$:  
$$ H(40) = 11 + \frac{1}{10} \cdot 40 = 11 + 4 = 15 $$  

The squared loss is:  
$$ L = (y - H(x_i))^2 $$  

Substituting $y = 11$ (actual) and $H(x_i) = 15$ (predicted):  
$$ L = (11 - 15)^2 = (-4)^2 = 16 $$

Is it possible to answer part (a) above **just** by knowing $\bar x$ and
$\bar y$, i.e. **without** knowing the values of $w_0^*$ and $w_1^*$?

( ) Yes; the values of $w_0^*$ and $w_1^*$ don't impact the answer to part (a).
( ) No; the values of $w_0^*$ and $w_1^*$ are necessary to answer part (a).

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: Yes; the values of $w_0^*$ and $w_1^*$ don't impact the answer to part (a).

A fact from lecture is that the regression line always passes through the point $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$, meaning that for an average x, we always predict an average y. Weâ€™re given that $\bar{x}$ = 40 and $\bar{y}$ = 15, meaning that for a product that costs $40 we will predict that it has 15 ingredients, no matter what the slope and intercept end up being.

Suppose $x_i$ represents the price of product $i$, and suppose $u_i$
represents the **negative price** of product $i$. In other words, for
$i = 1, 2, ..., n$, where $n$ is the number of points in our dataset:

$$u_i = - x_i$$

Suppose $U$ is the design matrix for the simple linear regression model
that uses **negative** price to predict number of ingredients. Which of
the following matrices could be $U^TU$?

( ) \ $\begin{bmatrix} -15 & 600 \\ 600 & -30000 \end{bmatrix}$ \
( ) \ $\begin{bmatrix} 15 & -600 \\ -600 & 30000 \end{bmatrix}$ \
( ) \ $\begin{bmatrix} -15 & 450 \\ 450 & -30000 \end{bmatrix}$ \
( ) \ $\begin{bmatrix} 15 & -450 \\ -450 & 30000 \end{bmatrix}$ \



# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $$\begin{bmatrix} 15 & -600 \\ -600 & 30000 \end{bmatrix}$$

The design matrix $U$ is defined as:
$$
U =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -x_1 \\
1 & -x_2 \\
\vdots & \vdots \\
1 & -x_n
\end{bmatrix}
$$
where 1 represents the intercept term, and $-x_i$ represents the negative price of product $i$. Thus:

$$
U^T U =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
-x_1 & -x_2 & \cdots & -x_n
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -x_1 \\
1 & -x_2 \\
\vdots & \vdots \\
1 & -x_n
\end{bmatrix}
$$

When we multiply this out, we get: 
$$
U^T U =
\begin{bmatrix}
n & -\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i \\
-\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i & \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2
\end{bmatrix}
$$  

Conceptually, this matrix represents:  
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\text{Number of elements} & \text{Sum of the negative values of the data} \\
\text{Sum of the negative values of the data} & \text{Sum of squared values of the data}
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

We know that the sum of all elements in a series is equal to the mean of the series multiplied by the number of elements in the series.
$$
\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i = n \cdot \bar{x}
$$  

$\bar{x}$ is equal to $40$. The first element in the matrix, $15$, represents the number of elements in the series. Thus,  
$$
\displaystyle \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i = 40 \cdot 15 = 600
$$  
and the solution must be as follows:  

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
n & -\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i \\
-\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i & \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 15 & -600 \\ -600 & 30000 \end{bmatrix}
$$
