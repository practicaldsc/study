Consider a sample of 60 skincare products. The name of one product from
the sample is given below:

::: center
"our **drops** cream is the best **drops** **drops** for eye **drops**

The total number of terms in the product name above is unknown, but we
know that the term **drops** only appears in the name 5 times.

Suppose the TF-IDF of `drops` in the product name above is
$\frac{2}{3}$. Which of the following statements are **NOT possible**,
assuming we use a base-2 logarithm? Select all that apply.

[ ] **All** 60 product names contain the term `drops`, **including**
the one above.

[ ] 14 **other** product names contain the term `drops`, in addition
to the one above.

[ ] None of the 59 **other** product names contain the term `drops`.

[ ] There are 15 terms in the product name above **in total**.
