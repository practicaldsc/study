Consider a sample of 60 skincare products. The name of one product from
the sample is given below:

"our **drops** cream is the best **drops** **drops** for eye **drops**
**drops** proven formula\...\"

The total number of terms in the product name above is unknown, but we
know that the term **drops** only appears in the name 5 times.

Suppose the TF-IDF of `drops` in the product name above is
$\frac{2}{3}$. Which of the following statements are **NOT possible**,
assuming we use a base-2 logarithm? Select all that apply.

[ ] **All** 60 product names contain the term `drops`, **including** the one above.
[ ] 14 **other** product names contain the term `drops`, in addition to the one above.
[ ] None of the 59 **other** product names contain the term `drops`.
[ ] There are 15 terms in the product name above **in total**.
[ ] There are 25 terms in the product name above **in total**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 

- **All** 60 product names contain the term `drops`.  
- None of the 59 **other** product names contain the term `drops`.  
- There are 25 terms in the product name above **in total**.

The TF-IDF score of a term is calculated as:
$$
\text{TF-IDF} = \text{TF} \cdot \text{IDF}
$$
Where:

- $\text{TF}$: Term Frequency in a document (the ratio of the term's occurrences to the total number of terms in the document).

- $\text{IDF}$: Inverse Document Frequency, which is given by:
  $$
  \text{IDF} = \log_2\left(\frac{N}{1 + n}\right)
  $$
  Here:

  - $N$: Total number of documents (60 in this case).

  - $n$: Number of documents containing the term.

The TF-IDF of `drops` in the product name is given as $\frac{2}{3}$.

**Step 1: Calculating Term Frequency (TF)**
The problem states that the term `drops` appears \textbf{5 times} in the product name. If the total number of terms in the product name is $T$, then:
$$
\text{TF} = \frac{5}{T}
$$

---

**Step 2: Calculating Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**
Substitute the known values into the IDF formula:
$$
\text{IDF} = \log_2\left(\frac{60}{1 + n}\right)
$$
Where $n$ is the number of other product names (out of 59) that contain `drops`.

---

**Step 3: Combine TF and IDF to Match TF-IDF**
The TF-IDF is given as $\frac{2}{3}$. Substituting the expressions for TF and IDF:
$$
\frac{5}{T} \cdot \log_2\left(\frac{60}{1 + n}\right) = \frac{2}{3}
$$

**Step 4: Analyze Each Option**

\textbf{Option 1: All 60 product names contain the term `drops`.}  
If all 60 product names contain `drops`, then $n = 59$. Substituting into the IDF formula:
$$
\text{IDF} = \log_2\left(\frac{60}{1 + 59}\right) = \log_2(1) = 0
$$
Since $\text{IDF} = 0$, the TF-IDF score would also be 0, which contradicts the given TF-IDF of $\frac{2}{3}$.

**This is NOT possible.**

---

\textbf{Option 2: 14 other product names contain the term `drops`.}  
If 14 other product names contain `drops`, then $n = 14$. Substituting into the IDF formula:
$$
\text{IDF} = \log_2\left(\frac{60}{1 + 14}\right) = \log_2\left(\frac{60}{15}\right) = \log_2(4) = 2
$$
Substituting $\text{IDF} = 2$ into the TF-IDF equation:
$$
\frac{5}{T} \cdot 2 = \frac{2}{3}
$$
Solving for $T$:
$$
\frac{10}{T} = \frac{2}{3} \implies T = 15
$$
This within the problem's constraints.

**This is possible.**

---

\textbf{Option 3: None of the 59 other product names contain the term `drops`.}  
If no other product names contain `drops`, then $n = 0$. Substituting into the IDF formula:
$$
\text{IDF} = \log_2\left(\frac{60}{1 + 0}\right) = \log_2(60)
$$
Approximating $\log_2(60) \approx 5.91$, substituting into the TF-IDF equation:
$$
\frac{5}{T} \cdot 5.91 = \frac{2}{3}
$$
Solving for $T$:
$$
\frac{29.55}{T} = \frac{2}{3} \implies T \approx 44.33
$$
Since $T$ must be an integer, this is not consistent with the problem's constraints.

**This is NOT possible.**

---

\textbf{Option 4: There are 15 terms in the product name above in total.}  
If $T = 15$, substituting into the TF equation:
$$
\text{TF} = \frac{5}{15} = \frac{1}{3}
$$
Substituting $\text{TF} = \frac{1}{3}$ into the TF-IDF equation:
$$
\frac{1}{3} \cdot \text{IDF} = \frac{2}{3} \implies \text{IDF} = 2
$$
Substituting $\text{IDF} = 2$ into the IDF formula:
$$
2 = \log_2\left(\frac{60}{1 + n}\right)
$$
$$
2 = \log_2(4) \implies \frac{60}{1 + n} = 4 \implies n = 14
$$
This is consistent with the problem's constraints.

**This is possible.**

---

\textbf{Option 5: There are 25 terms in the product name above in total.}  
If $T = 25$, substituting into the TF equation:
$$
\text{TF} = \frac{5}{25} = \frac{1}{5}
$$
Substituting $\text{TF} = \frac{1}{5}$ into the TF-IDF equation:
$$
\frac{1}{5} \cdot \text{IDF} = \frac{2}{3} \implies \text{IDF} = \frac{10}{3}
$$
Substituting $\text{IDF} = \frac{10}{3}$ into the IDF formula:
$$
\frac{10}{3} = \log_2\left(\frac{60}{1 + n}\right)
$$
This results in a value for $n$ that is not an integer. 

**This is NOT possible.**
