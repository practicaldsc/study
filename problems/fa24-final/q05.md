Consider a sample of 60 skincare products. The name of one product from
the sample is given below:

  "our **drops** cream is the best **drops** **drops** for eye **drops**
        **drops** proven formula\...\"

The total number of terms in the product name above is unknown, but we
know that the term **drops** only appears in the name 5 times.

Suppose the TF-IDF of **drops** in the product name above is
$\frac{2}{3}$. Which of the following statements are **NOT possible**,
assuming we use a base-2 logarithm? Select all that apply.

[ ] **All** 60 product names contain the term **drops**, **including** the one above.
[ ] 14 **other** product names contain the term **drops**, in addition to the one above.
[ ] None of the 59 **other** product names contain the term **drops**.
[ ] There are 15 terms in the product name above **in total**.
[ ] There are 25 terms in the product name above **in total**.

**Answer**: 

- **All** 60 product names contain the term **drops**.  
- None of the 59 **other** product names contain the term **drops**.  
- There are 25 terms in the product name above **in total**.

The TF-IDF score of a term is calculated as:
$$
\text{tf-idf}(t,d) = \text{tf}(t,d) \cdot \text{idf}(t)
                    = \frac{\# \text{ of occurrences of } t \text{ in } d }{\text{total } \# \text{ of terms in } d} \cdot \log_2\left(\frac{\text{total } \# \text{ of documents}}{\# \text{ of documents in which } t \text{ appears}}\right)
$$


We know: 

- $t$ appears 5 times in $d$ 

- Total number of documents = 60 

- $\text{TF-IDF} = \frac{2}{3}$ 


Let $T$ be the total number of terms in $d$ ($d$ refers to the sentence at the top) and $n$ refer to number of documents in which $t$ appears, then substituting this into our formula gives us:
$$
\frac{5}{T} \cdot \log_2\left(\frac{60}{n}\right) = \frac{2}{3}
$$

The problem then boils down to checking whether the above equation holds true in each of the five options

* **Option 1: All 60 product names contain the term **drops**.** 
  - If $n = 60$, then $\log_2(60/60) = 0$.
  - This makes TF-IDF = 0, contradicting $\frac{2}{3}$. \

  **This is NOT possible.**

* **Option 2: 14 other product names contain the term **drops**.**
  - If $n = 15$ (original document + 14 others), $\log_2(60/15) = 2$.
  - $\frac{5}{T} \cdot 2 = \frac{2}{3}$ implies $T = 15$. \

  **This is possible.**

* **Option 3: None of the 59 other product names contain the term **drops**.**
  - If $n = 1$, $\log_2(60/1) \approx 5.91$.
  - This leads to a non-integer total terms $T$.
  - Since $T$ must be an integer, this is not consistent with the problem's constraints. \

  **This is NOT possible.**

* **Option 4: There are 15 terms in the product name above in total.**
  If $T = 15$, substituting into the TF equation, we get:

  $\text{TF} = \frac{5}{15} = \frac{1}{3}$

  $\frac{1}{3} \cdot \text{IDF} = \frac{2}{3} \implies \text{IDF} = 2$

  Substituting $\text{IDF} = 2$ into the IDF formula:

  $$
  2 = \log_2\left(\frac{60}{n}\right)
  $$
  $$
  2 = \log_2(4) \implies \frac{60}{n} = 4 \implies n = 15
  $$
  
  This is consistent with the problem's constraints.

  **This is possible.**
 

* **Option 5: There are 25 terms in the product name above in total.**
If $T = 25$, substituting into the TF equation:
$$
\text{TF} = \frac{5}{25} = \frac{1}{5}
$$
Substituting $\text{TF} = \frac{1}{5}$ into the TF-IDF equation:
$$
\frac{1}{5} \cdot \text{IDF} = \frac{2}{3} \implies \text{IDF} = \frac{10}{3}
$$
Substituting $\text{IDF} = \frac{10}{3}$ into the IDF formula:
$$
\frac{10}{3} = \log_2\left(\frac{60}{n}\right)
$$
This results in a value for $n$ that is not an integer. 

  **This is NOT possible.**
