# BEGIN PROB

In this problem, we'll work with the DataFrame `dogs`, which contains one row for every registered pet dog in Zurich, Switzerland in 2017.

The first few rows of `dogs` are shown below, but `dogs` has many more rows than are shown.

- `"owner_id" (int)`: A unique ID for each owner. Note that, for example, there are two rows in the preview for `4215`, meaning that owner has at least 2 dogs. **Assume that if an `"owner_id"` appears in `dogs` multiple times, the corresponding `"owner_age"`, `"owner_sex"`, and `"district"` are always the same.**
- `"owner_age" (str)`: The age group of the owner; either `"11-20"`, `"21-30"`, ..., or `"91-100"` (9 possibilities in total).
- `"owner_sex" (str)`: The birth sex of the owner; either `"m"` (male) or `"f"` (female).
- `"district" (int)`: The city district the owner lives in; a positive integer between `1` and `12` (inclusive).
- `"primary_breed" (str)`: The primary breed of the dog.
- `"secondary_breed" (str)`: The secondary breed of the dog. If this column is not null, the dog is a "mixed breed" dog; otherwise, the dog is a "purebred" dog.
- `"dog_sex" (str)`: The birth sex of the dog; either `"m"` (male) or `"f"` (female).
- `"birth_year" (int)`: The birth year of the dog.


# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blank so that `most_common` evaluates to the most common
district in `dogs`. Assume there are no ties.

```py
most_common = ____
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:

```py
dogs["district"].value_counts().idxmax()
```

Above, we presented one possible solution, but there are many:

- `dogs["district"].value_counts().idxmax()`
- `dogs["district"].value_counts().index[0]`
- `dogs.groupby("district").size().sort_values(ascending=False).index[0]`
- `dogs.groupby("district").count()["owner_id"].sort_values(ascending=False).index[0]`

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blank so that `female_breeds` evaluates to a Series
containing the primary breeds of all female dogs.

```py
female_breeds = dogs.____
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:

```py
loc[dogs["dog_sex"] == "f", "primary_breed"]
```

Another possible answer is:

```py
query("dog_sex == 'f'")["primary_breed"]`

Note that the question _didn't_ ask for unique primary breeds.
