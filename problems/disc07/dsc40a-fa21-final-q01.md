The mean of 12 non-negative numbers is 45. Suppose we remove 2 of these numbers. What is the largest possible value of the mean of the remaining 10 numbers? Show your work.

# BEGIN SOLN

$54$.

To maximize the mean of the remaining 10 numbers, we want to minimize the numbers that are removed. The smallest possible non-negative number is 0, so to maximize the mean of the remaining 10, we should remove two 0s from the set of numbers. Recall that the sum of the 12 number set is $12 \cdot 45$; then, the maximum possible mean of the remaining 10 is

$$\frac{12 \cdot 45 - 2 \cdot 0}{10} = \frac{6}{5} \cdot 45 = 54$$
