In this question, we'll consider the phone number 6789998212 (mentioned in Soulja Boy's 2008 classic, "Kiss Me thru the Phone").

**Note:** In this problem, you may leave your answers in terms of ${n \choose k}$, $P(n, k)$, and/or factorials. However, you must provide a one-sentence explanation for your answer in each subpart.

# BEGIN SUBPROB 
How many permutations of 6789998212 are there?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

There are ${10 \choose 1}{9 \choose 1}{8 \choose 2}{6 \choose 3}{3 \choose 2}{1 \choose 1}$ permutations.

If all digits in 6789998212 were *unique*, there would be $10!$ permutations. However, some of the digits are repeated; for each repeated digit, we need to divide by the number of ways to re-arrange the repeated digits amongst themselves.

Let's count the number of occurrences of each digit.

- 6: 1 occurrence
- 7: 1 occurrence
- 8: 2 occurrences
- 9: 3 occurrences
- 2: 2 occurrences
- 1: 1 occurrence


Thus, the number of permutations of 6789998212 is

$$\frac{10!}{2! 3! 2!}$$

Another way to arrive at this result is by saying first, we need to choose 1 of the 10 positions to contain a 1. Then, we need to choose 1 of the remaining 9 positions to contain a 7. Then, we need to choose 2 of the remaining 8 positions to contain a 8, and so on and so forth. This method yields

$${10 \choose 1}{9 \choose 1}{8 \choose 2}{6 \choose 3}{3 \choose 2}{1 \choose 1}$$

If you expand out this result, you'll see that it's equal to the first result. You may also notice that this is equivalent to ${10 \choose 3}{7 \choose 2}{5 \choose 2}{3 \choose 1}{2 \choose 1}{1 \choose 1}$, which follows the same approach but chooses locations for the repeated characters first.

# BEGIN SUBPROB 
How many permutations of 6789998212 have all three 9s next to each other?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

There are $\displaystyle \frac{8!}{2!2!}$ permutations.

The key insight here is that we can treat all three 9s as being just a single character, X, and determine the number of permutations of the 8-character string 678X8212. To do so, we again count the number of occurrences of each digit:

- 6: 1 occurrence
- 7: 1 occurrence
- 8: 2 occurrences
- X: 1 occurrence
- 2: 2 occurrences
- 1: 1 occurrence


Thus, the number of permutations of 6789998212 with all 3 9s appearing together is

$$\frac{8!}{2!2!}$$

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB 
How many permutations of 6789998212 end with a 1 and start with a 6?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

There are $\displaystyle \frac{8!}{2! 3! 2!}$ permutations.

Similarly to the previous part, we can "fix" the 1 at the start and 6 at the end. All we really need to determine is the number of permutations of 78999822, which is

$$\frac{8!}{2! 3! 2!}$$

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB 
How many different 3 digit numbers with unique digits can we create by selecting digits from 6789998212?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

There are $\displaystyle \frac{8!}{2! 3! 2!} = 120$ permutations.

The key here is that the 3 digit numbers that we're creating must have unique digits. There are 6 unique digits in 6789998212: 6, 7, 8, 9, 2, 1.

There are 6 options for the first digit of our 3 digit number, 5 options for the second digit, and 4 options for the third digit. Thus, the number of 3 digit numbers we can create in this way is $6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 = 120$. This is also ${6 \choose 3} \cdot {3!}$ (Choosing three elements from six, multiplying by $3!$ because order matters).
