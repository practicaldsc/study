Billy brings you back to Dirty Birds, the restaurant where he is a waiter. He tells you that Dirty Birds has 30 different flavors of chicken wings, 18 of which are 'wet' (e.g. honey garlic) and 12 of which are 'dry' (e.g. lemon pepper).

Each time you place an order at Dirty Birds, you get to pick 4 different flavors. The order in which you pick your flavors does not matter.

**Note:** In this problem, you may leave your answers in terms of ${n \choose k}$, $P(n, k)$, and/or factorials. However, you must provide a one-sentence explanation for your answer in each subpart.


# BEGIN SUBPROB
How many ways can we select 4 flavors in total?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

$${30 \choose 4}$$

There are 30 total flavors and we want to select 4 such that order does not matter. In this subpart we don't care about whether our flavors are dry or wet.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB
How many ways can we select 4 flavors such that we select an equal number of wet and dry flavors?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

$${18 \choose 2}{12 \choose 2}$$

To select an equal number of wet and dry flavors, we need to select 2 wet flavors and 2 dry flavors. There are 18 wet flavors, so there are ${18 \choose 2}$ ways to select 2 of them. Similarly, there are ${12 \choose 2}$ ways to select 2 of the 12 dry flavors. We need to select 18 wet flavors AND 12 dry flavors, so we multiply these numbers.

Billy tells you he'll surprise you with 4 different flavors, randomly selected from the 30 flavors available. What's the probability that he brings you at least one wet flavor and and least one dry flavor?

# BEGIN SOLUTION
$$1 - \frac{{18 \choose 4}}{{30 \choose 4}} - \frac{{12 \choose 4}}{{30 \choose 4}}$$

Note that the event "Billy brings you at least one wet flavor and at least one dry flavor" is the complement of the event "Billy brings you only wet flavors or only dry flavors". Thus, we can find the probability that Billy brings you only wet flavors or only dry flavors and subtract it from 1, using the complement rule.

To find the probability that Billy brings you only wet flavors, we first count the number of ways to select 4 wet flavors from 18; this is ${18 \choose 4}$. The total number of ways of selecting 4 flavors is ${30 \choose 4}$, hence the probability that he brings you only wet flavors is $\frac{{18 \choose 4}}{{30 \choose 4}}$. Similarly, the probability he brings you only dry flavors is $\frac{{18 \choose 4}}{{30 \choose 4}}$. Since the events "Billy brings you only wet flavors" and "Billy brings you only dry flavors" are mutually exclusive, we can add these probabilities to find the probability of the event "Billy brings you only wet flavors or only dry flavors", yielding $\frac{{18 \choose 4}}{{30 \choose 4}} + \frac{{12 \choose 4}}{{30 \choose 4}}$. We subtract this number from 1 to get the desired result.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Suppose you go to Dirty Birds once a day for 7 straight days. Each time you go there, Billy brings you 4 different flavors, randomly selected from the 30 flavors available. What's the probability that on at least one of the 7 days, he brings you all wet flavors or all dry flavors? (_Note: All 4 flavors for a particular day must be different, but it is possible to get the same flavor on multiple days._)

# BEGIN SOLUTION
$$1 - \left[1 - \frac{{18 \choose 4}}{{30 \choose 4}} - \frac{{12 \choose 4}}{{30 \choose 4}} \right]^7$$

Note that the event "at least once, Billy brings you all wet or all dry wings" is the complement of the event "Billy never brings you all wet or all dry wings." This new event is equivalent to "Billy always brings you at least one wet flavor and at least one dry flavor."

In part (c), we found that for one particular day, the probability that Billy brings you at least one wet flavor and at least one dry flavor is $$1 - \frac{{18 \choose 4}}{{30 \choose 4}} - \frac{{12 \choose 4}}{{30 \choose 4}}.$$ Each day the flavors "reset" (we are told that flavors can be chosen on multiple days), and so this probability is the same for each of the 7 days. This makes the probability that he brings us at least one wet flavor and at least one dry flavor on all 7 days $\left[1 - \frac{{18 \choose 4}}{{30 \choose 4}} - \frac{{12 \choose 4}}{{30 \choose 4}} \right]^7$, and so the desired probability --- the probability that he brings us all wet flavors or all dry flavors on at least one of the 7 days --- is

$$1 - \left[1 - \frac{{18 \choose 4}}{{30 \choose 4}} - \frac{{12 \choose 4}}{{30 \choose 4}} \right]^7$$
