Consider a set of 8 data points, $y_1, y_2, ..., y_8$ that are in sorted order, i.e. $y_1 < y_2 < ... < y_8$. Suppose that $y_4 = 10$, $y_5 = 14$, and $y_6 = 22$. Recall that mean absolute error, $R_{abs}(h)$, is defined as $R_{abs}(h) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n |y_i - h|$. Suppose that $R_{abs}(11) = 9$.

What is $R_{abs}(22)$? Show your work.

_Hint: Use the formula for the slope of $R$ at $h$._

# BEGIN SOLN

$$R_{abs}(22) = 11$$

We can write the points given to us as:

$$y_1, y_2, y_3, 10, 14, 22, y_7, y_8$$

Since there are an even number of data points, all values of $h$ between the middle two points minimize $R_{abs}(h)$. In this case, all values of $h$ in the interval $[10, 14]$ minimize $R_{abs}(h)$ and, as a result, have the same value of $R_{abs}(h)$. Thus, $R_{abs}(14) = R_{abs}(11) = 9$.

From lecture, we know that:

$$\text{slope of $R$ at $h$} = \frac{1}{n} \left( \left(\text{\# points } < h\right) - \left(\text{\# points } > h\right)\right)$$

We can use this formula to determine what to add to $R_{abs}(14)$ to get $R_{abs}(22)$. For any $h$ in the interval $(14, 22)$, the slope of $R$ at $h$ (given by plugging any $h \in (14, 22)$ into the slope equation)is $\frac{1}{8} (5 - 3) = \frac{1}{4}$. This means that for every 1 unit we move to the right from $h = 14$ until we get to $h = 22$, $R_{abs}(h)$ increases by $\frac{1}{4}$. So,

$$R_{abs}(22) = R_{abs}(14) + (22 - 14) \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 9 + 2 = 11$$
