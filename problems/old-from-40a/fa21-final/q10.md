Suppose you're given the following probabilities:

- $P(A | B) = \frac{2}{5}$
- $P(B | A) = \frac{1}{4}$
- $P(A | C) = \frac{2}{3}$

# BEGIN SUBPROB
If $A$ and $C$ are independent, what is $P(B)$? Show your work.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

$$P(B) = \frac{5}{12}$$

If $A$ and $C$ are independent, then $P(A) = P(A | C) = \frac{2}{3}$. Then, from Bayes' rule, we have

$$
\begin{align}
P(A | B) &= \frac{P(A) P(B|A)}{P(B)} \\
\implies P(B) &= \frac{P(A) P(B|A)}{P(A|B)}\\
&= \frac{\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{4}}{\frac{2}{5}} \\
&= \frac{5}{12}
\end{align}
$$

# BEGIN SUBPROB 
Suppose $A$ and $C$ are not independent, and now suppose that $P(A | \overline{C}) = \frac{1}{5}$. Given that $A$ and $B$ are independent, what is $P(C)$? Show your work.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

$$P(C) = \frac{3}{7}$$

Since we're given that $A$ and $B$ are independent, $P(A) = P(A | B) = \frac{2}{5}$. By the Law of Total Probability, we have

$$P(A) = P(A \cap C) + P(A \cap \overline{C}) = P(C) P(A | C) + P(\overline{C}) P(A | \overline{C})$$

For simplicity, let $p = P(C)$. Then, substituting in our known values $P(A)$, $P(A | C)$, and $P(A | \overline{C})$ and solving for $p$ yields

\begin{align*}
    P(A) = P(A \cap C) + P(A \cap \overline{C}) &= P(C) P(A | C) + P(\overline{C}) P(A | \overline{C}) \\
    \frac{2}{5} &= \frac{2}{3} p + \frac{1}{5} (1 - p) \\
    \frac{2}{5} &= \left(\frac{10}{15} - \frac{3}{15} \right)p + \frac{1}{5} \\
    \frac{1}{5} &= \frac{7}{15} p \\
    p &= \frac{15}{7} \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{3}{7}
\end{align*}

Thus, $P(C) = \frac{3}{7}$.
