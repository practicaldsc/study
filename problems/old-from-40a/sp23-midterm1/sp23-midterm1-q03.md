In general, the logarithm of a convex function is not convex. Give an example of a function $f(x)$ such that $f(x)$ is convex, but $\log_{10}(f(x))$ is not convex.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

There are many correct answers to this question. Some simple answers are $f(x) = x$ and $f(x) = x^2$. The logarithms of these function are $\log_{10}(x)$ and $2\log_{10}(x)$, both of which are nonconvex because there are pairs of points such that the line connecting them goes below the function.
