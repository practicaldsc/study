Consider the following information:

- $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix.
- $\vec{b}$ is an arbitrary $n$-dimensional vector
- $\vec{c}$ is the $m$-dimensional vector formed by multiplying $A$ with $\vec{b}$.
- $\vec{d}$ is an arbitrary $m$-dimensional vector.
- $\vec{e}$ is the $m$-dimensional vector formed by $\vec{d} - \vec{c}$.


If $\vec{e}$ is orthogonal to every column in $A$, prove that $\vec{b}$ must satisfy the following equation:

$$
A^T A \vec{b} = A^T \vec{d}.
$$

\textit{Hint: If the columns of a matrix $A$ are orthogonal to a vector $\vec{v}$, then $A^T \vec{v} = 0$}.
