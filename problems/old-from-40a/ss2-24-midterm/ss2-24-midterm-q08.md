Fill in the blanks for each set of vectors below to accurately describe their relationship and span.

$$\vec{a} = \begin{bmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix} \qquad \vec{b} = \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$$

"$\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ are  \_\_(i)\_\_, meaning they span a  \_\_(ii)\_\_. The vector  $\vec{a} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$  \_\_(iii)\_\_ in the span of $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$. $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ are  \_\_(iv)\_\_, meaning the angle between them is \_\_(v)\_\_"
