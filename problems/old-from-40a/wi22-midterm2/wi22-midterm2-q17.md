In today's Quadringle puzzle, the four strings are all very
similar:

::: center
DEALER, RELAYS, ALLOYS, and SALADS.
:::

Suppose you pick one of these four strings at random, so that each has a
$\frac14$ probability of being chosen. Then you choose one letter of
that word at random, such that each has a $\frac16$ probability of being
chosen.

It turns out that you picked an L. What is the probability that your L
came from the word SALADS?

( ) $\dfrac{1}{24}$
( ) $\dfrac{1}{6}$
( ) $\dfrac{1}{5}$
( ) $\dfrac{1}{4}$
( ) None of the above.
