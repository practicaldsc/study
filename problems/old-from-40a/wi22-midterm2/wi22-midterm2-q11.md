Suppose your Stringle strategy is to guess a random six-letter string every time. That is, each guess you make is equally likely to be any six-letter string, and you don't incorporate the feedback from your prior guesses into subsequent guesses. You might even guess the same string twice!

With this (horrible) strategy, what is the probability that your Stringle score for today is 8?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

$$\left( 1 - \frac{1}{26^6}\right)^7\cdot \left( \frac{1}{26^6}\right)$$

# END SOLUTION

# END PROB
