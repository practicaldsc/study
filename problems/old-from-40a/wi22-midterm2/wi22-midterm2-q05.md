What is the probability that today's String string has the
last three letters matching the first three letters, like BAMBAM or
GOOGOO, if we know that the first letter matches the fourth letter?

( ) $\dfrac{1}{26^2}$\
( ) $\dfrac{1}{26^3}$\
( ) $\dfrac{P(26,3)}{P(26,5)}$\
( ) $\dfrac{P(26,3)}{26^6}$\
( ) None of the above.
