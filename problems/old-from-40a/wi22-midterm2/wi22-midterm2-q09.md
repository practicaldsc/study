Your first guess for today's Stringle has six distinct
letters. There are $3^6$ possible colored feedback sequences for this
first guess, since each of the six letters could be colored one of three
colors: green, yellow, or gray. How many of the $3^6$ possible feedback
sequences for your first guess include 2 green letters, 2 yellow
letters, and 2 gray letters?

( ) $6!$\
( ) $C(6.3)$\
( ) $(C(6,2))^3$\
( ) $C(6,2)\cdot C(4,2)$\
( ) None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

$C(6,2)\cdot C(4,2)$

# END SOLUTION
