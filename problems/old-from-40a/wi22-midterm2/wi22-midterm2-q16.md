Stringle has become such a popular game that many spin-offs
have been created. In a variant called Quadringle, players have to solve
four different Stringle puzzles at the same time. We'll say that a
Quadringle puzzle is determined by which four six-letter strings it
includes, and the order of those four strings does not matter. How many
Quadringle puzzles are possible?

( ) $(26^6)^4$
( ) $C(26^6,4)$
( ) $P(26^6, 4)$
( ) $4^{C(26,6)}$
( ) None of the above.
