For this problem, we'll say that there are six vowels: A, E, I, O, U, and Y. What is the probability that today's Stringle string satisfies at least one of the following conditions?

-   starts with a vowel

-   ends with a vowel

-   first two letters are the same

# BEGIN SOLUTION

$$\frac{6}{26}+\frac{6}{26}+\frac{1}{26} - \frac{6}{26}\cdot \frac{6}{26}-\frac{6}{26}\cdot \frac{1}{26} - \frac{6}{26}\cdot \frac{1}{26}+\frac{6}{26}\cdot \frac{6}{26}\cdot \frac{1}{26} = 1 - \frac{20}{26}\cdot \frac{20}{26}\cdot \frac{25}{26}$$
