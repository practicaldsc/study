This problem is a continuation of the previous problem, using
the same survey results.

After making predictions for various individuals based on their answers
to all four survey questions, you realize that in every case, regardless
of how the person answered the survey questions, you could make the same
prediction using only three of the four survey questions. For this data,
which survey question can you safely remove, without changing the
results of your naive Bayes classifier?

( ) Do you play Stringle every day?
( ) Do you share your Stringle results with friends or family?
( ) Do you record your Stringle scores anywhere?
( ) Have you ever recommended Stringle to someone you know?
( ) None of the above. Removing any question will change the results of the naive Bayes classifier.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

Do you share your Stringle results with friends or family?
