<i>Source: [Winter 2022 Midterm 2](../wi22-midterm2/index.html), Problem 10</i>

Consider the following three events:

-   $A$ is the event that today's Stringle string has a duplicate letter.

-   $B$ is the event that today's Stringle string starts with a $B$.

-   $C$ is the event that today's Stringle string has the same first and last letter.

Which of the following is true?

( ) $A$ and $B$ are independent. $A$ and $C$ are independent. $B$ and $C$ are dependent.
( ) $A$ and $B$ are dependent. $A$ and $C$ are independent. $B$ and $C$ are independent.
( ) $A$ and $B$ are independent. $A$ and $C$ are dependent. $B$ and $C$ are dependent.
( ) $A$ and $B$ are dependent. $A$ and $C$ are dependent. $B$ and $C$ are independent.
( ) None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

None of the above.

We can test if two events, $X$ and $Z$ are independent by using the equation: $\mathbb{P}(X \cap Z) = \mathbb{P}(X) \cdot \mathbb{P}(Z)$.

- We know the probability of $\mathbb{P}(A) = \frac{}{}$ because ... this is combinatorics
