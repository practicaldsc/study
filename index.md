Welcome to the **Study Site**! This site contains practice problems taken from prior offerings of _Practical Data Science_ and related courses taught at UC San Diego. The problems here will be similar in style to the problems on our exams, but they will not be identical â€“ expect to be challenged!

In typical Fall/Winter terms, discussion sections are used to prepare students for exams, by having students work through worksheets with theoretical practice problems from related courses. Given that weâ€™ve replaced discussion sections with study sessions, we have instead decided to post all Fall/Winter discussion worksheets at the start of the semester, and encourage you to dedicate several hours per week to working through these worksheets.

Practice worksheets are organized by topic. In addition, you can find the exams from the Fall 2024 and Winter 2025 offerings of this class specifically at the bottom of the page.

You should work on these problems **on paper**, since your exams will also be on paper. Even though you will see some multiple choice bubbles, you intentionally cannot select them.

### Worksheets

Problems are sorted by topic in the worksheets below. Each worksheet also has a link to the discussion review slides for that week from Winter 2025.

- [Arrays and Probability](disc02/index.html) ([slides](../assets/disc-slides/disc02.html))
- [DataFrames and Querying](disc03/index.html) ([slides](../assets/disc-slides/disc03.html))
- [Grouping, Merging, and Pivoting](disc04/index.html) ([slides](../assets/disc-slides/disc04.html))
- [Visualization, Imputation, and Web Scraping](disc05/index.html) ([slides](../assets/disc-slides/disc05.html))
- [Regular Expressions and Text Features](disc06/index.html) ([slides](../assets/disc-slides/disc06.html))
- [Loss Functions and Simple Linear Regression](disc07/index.html) ([slides](../assets/disc-slides/disc07.html))
- [Multiple Linear Regression](disc08/index.html) ([slides](../assets/disc-slides/disc08.html))
- [Feature Engineering and Pipelines](disc09/index.html) ([slides](../assets/disc-slides/disc09.html))
- [Cross-Validation and Regularization](disc10/index.html) ([slides](../assets/disc-slides/disc10.html))
- [Gradient Descent and Classification](disc11/index.html) ([slides](../assets/disc-slides/disc11.html))
- [Logistic Regression](disc12/index.html) ([slides](../assets/disc-slides/disc12.html))
- [Clustering](disc13/index.html) ([slides](../assets/disc-slides/disc13.html))

In addition, we have a few "review" worksheets which contain topics from multiple weeks, designed to be completed in the few days before an exam. You can treat them like mock exams, with the caveat that these worksheets contain topics from several different old exams, and were never tested as real exams, and so they may be too long or short and be missing topics.

- [Midterm Review](mt-review/index.html)
- [Final Review, Worksheet 1](fi-review-1/index.html)
- [Final Review, Worksheet 2](fi-review-2/index.html)

### ðŸ§ª Exams

<b>Note: We recommend setting aside these exams as complete "practice exams" that you can work on in their entirety. That is, DON'T look at them until you've already studied for the exams, using the worksheets above!</b>
