Welcome to the **Study Site**! This site contains practice problems taken from prior offerings of _Practical Data Science_ and related courses taught at UC San Diego. The problems here will be similar in style to the problems on our exams, but they will not be identical â€“ expect to be challenged!

Problems are organized in two ways:

- Most problems are organized into **discussion worksheets**. Each discussion problem set contains problems about a particular topic. Come to discussions to work on these problem sets in groups, with the help of our course staff. Solutions will be made available each week after all discussion sections have concluded.
- You can find the exams for this class specifically in the second table. (There's only one exam here so far â€“ the Fall 2024 Midterm Exam â€“ but its detailed solutions are available, too.)

You should work on these problems **on paper**, since your exams will also be on paper. Even though you will see some multiple choice bubbles, you intentionally cannot select them.
