Suppose, again, that we fit a logistic regression model that predicts
whether a product is designed for sensitive skin. We're deciding between
three thresholds, $A$, $B$, and $C$, all of which are real numbers
between 0 and 1 (inclusive). If a product's predicted probability of
being designed for sensitive skin is above our chosen threshold, we
predict they belong to class 1 (yes); otherwise, we predict class 0
(no).

The confusion matrices of our model on the test set for all three
thresholds are shown below.

$$\begin{array}{ccc}
\textbf{$A$} & \textbf{$B$} & \textbf{$C$} \\
\begin{array}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
& \text{Pred.} \: 0 & \text{Pred.} \: 1 \\
\hline
\text{Actually} \: 0 & 40 & 5 \\
\hline
\text{Actually} \: 1 & 35 & 35 \\
\hline
\end{array}
&
\begin{array}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
& \text{Pred.} \: 0 & \text{Pred.} \: 1 \\
\hline
\text{Actually} \: 0 & 5 & 40 \\
\hline
\text{Actually} \: 1 & 10 & ??? \\
\hline
\end{array}
&
\begin{array}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
& \text{Pred.} \: 0 & \text{Pred.} \: 1 \\
\hline
\text{Actually} \: 0 & 10 & 35 \\
\hline
\text{Actually} \: 1 & 30 & 40 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\end{array}$$

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose we choose threshold $A$, i.e. the **leftmost** confusion matrix.
What is the precision of the resulting predictions? Give your answer as
an **unsimplified fraction**.

What is the missing value (???) in the confusion matrix for threshold

Using the information in the three confusion matrices, arrange the
thresholds from **largest to smallest**. Remember that
$0 \leq A, B, C \leq 1$.

Remember that in our classification problem, class 1 means the product
**is** designed for sensitive skin, and class 0 means the product **is
not** designed for sensitive skin. In one or two English sentences,
explain which is **worse** in this context and **why**: a false positive
or a false negative.

A false positive is worse, as it would mean we predict a product is safe
when it isn't; someone with sensitive skin may use it and it could harm
them.
