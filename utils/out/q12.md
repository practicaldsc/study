Consider the string `thoughts`, defined below:

    thoughts = """Brought my Sony A5000 for my trip
                  the Airbus A220v300's bathroom has a window
                  My favorite jet is the B737-900ER flew it like x 239
                  all stan the queen B747, 120% the B333st
                  I like the chonky A380
                  but I love the A350"""

There are exactly 5 valid **plane codes** in `thoughts`: `"A220"`,
`"B737"`, `"B747"`, `"A380"`, and `"A350"`. For each regular expression
`exp` below,

-   specify the number of valid plane codes that the expression
    `re.findall(exp, thoughts)` extracts in their entirety, and

-   specify the number of **other, invalid** strings that
    `re.findall(exp, thoughts)` also extracts.

The first example has been done for you.
