The following bag of words matrix represents the frequencies of various
words across four reviews. Assume, just for this question, that the only
five words that appear in any review are the columns of this matrix, and
**all calculations use a base-2 logarithm**.

The matrix has three unknown **integer** values, $A$, $B$, and $C$.
However, we're given that:

-   The TF-IDF of `"movies"` in Review 0 is $\frac{5}{4}$.

-   The TF-IDF of `"landing"` in Review 2 is $\frac{1}{5}$.

-   The cosine similarity between the bag of words vectors for Reviews 1
    and 2 is $\frac{16}{21}$.
