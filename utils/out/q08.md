Suppose we build a classifier to predict whether a fish is of species
Bream (class 1) or not (class 0), given its height and/or weight.

Consider the training set of $n=40$ points below. Note that the 10
points in black correspond to class 1, and the 30 points correspond to
class 0. Assume there are no black points hidden under outlined points
and vice versa.

For your convenience, we show the training set of $n=40$ points again

Suppose we use height ($x_i$) **only** to predict species. If we use
logistic regression without regularization, which option best describes
the fit model, $P(y_i = 1 | x_i)$?

( ) $P(y_i = 1 | x_i) = \sigma \left(-15 - \frac{2}{3}x_i \right)$

For the rest of this question, suppose we use **both** height and weight
to predict species. Suppose we use logistic regression --- possibly with
regularization --- and choose a classification threshold of $T$, where
$0 \leq T \leq 1$. The resulting decision boundary is shown below, along
with the same training set as before (which has $n=40$ points, 10 of
which belong to class 1).

In the region above the line, shaded gray, our classifier predicts class
1 (Bream); in the region below the line, our classifier predicts class 0
(non-Bream).

( ) Yes, regularization was used

Suppose that each time we accidentally misclassify a fish's species as
Bream, we must pay a fine to the local aquarium. Given this fact alone,
is it more important for our classifier to have high precision or high
recall?

( ) High precision
