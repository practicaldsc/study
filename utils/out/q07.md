Consider the DataFrame `imp`, shown in its entirety below.

::: {.center}
![image](midterm-images/imp.png){width="35%"}

As in the previous question, we define the **robust mean** of a
collection of values to be the mean of all values, once the largest and
smallest values are removed. For example, the robust mean of
$2, 2, 3, 7, 12$ is $\frac{2+3+7}{3} = 4$.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose we use **robust mean imputation, conditional on `"cabin"`** to
fill in the missing values in the `"overall"` column. In doing so, what
are the missing values in the `"overall"` column filled in with? Give
your answers as **numbers**.

Missing value in row `9`: Missing value in row `10`:

Suppose `imp` represents the DataFrame above, with 2 missing values, and
`filled` represents the DataFrame that results from imputing the missing
values in `imp` in the way described in the previous part. In the
following code block, what is the value of `comp`?

    old_means = imp.groupby("cabin")["overall"].mean()
    comp = old_means == filled.groupby("cabin")["overall"].mean()

  --------------------------------------- -- --
  ( ) `True`                                 
  ( ) The Series `[True, True, True]`        
  ( ) The Series `[True, True, False]`       
  ( ) The Series `[False, True, True]`       
  ( ) The Series `[False, True, False]`

Hint: When grouping, the index is automatically sorted in ascending
order.
