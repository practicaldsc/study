Consider the DataFrame `lines`, created by keeping the rows in `reviews`
corresponding to reviews written between 2015-11-24 and 2015-11-28.
Remember, each row in `lines` corresponds to a review of an **airline**.

Also consider the DataFrame `ports`, in which each row corresponds to a
review of a particular **airport**. `ports` has a `"date"` column, too,
and also only has reviews written between 2015-11-24 and 2015-11-28.

Consider the following information.

    >>> lines["date"].value_counts().sort_index()
    2015-11-24      2
    2015-11-25      7
    2015-11-26      1
    2015-11-27      4
    >>> ports.shape[0]
    17
    >>> ports["date"].unique()
    array(["2015-11-26", "2015-11-27", "2015-11-28"])
    >>> lines.merge(ports, on="date", how="inner").shape[0]
    29
    >>> lines.merge(ports, on="date", how="outer").shape[0]
    41

Below, give your answers as **integers**.

Consider the following SQL query.

    SELECT author, AVG(overall) AS average_overall FROM reviews
    GROUP BY author
    HAVING AVG(overall) >= 8 AND COUNT(*) >= 5
    ORDER BY average_overall;

Now, consider the following four code blocks.

-   Block 1:

        f = lambda x: x["overall"].mean() >= 8 and x.shape[0] >= 5
        pop_auth = (reviews.groupby("author").filter(f)
                           .groupby("author")[["overall"]].mean()
                           .sort_values("overall").reset_index())

-   Block 2:

        g = lambda x: x.shape[0] >= 5
        pop_auth = (reviews[reviews["overall"] >= 8]
                    .groupby("author").filter(g)
                    .groupby("author")[["overall"]].mean()
                    .sort_values("overall").reset_index())

-   Block 3:

        pop_auth = (reviews["author"].value_counts().reset_index()
                    .merge(
                        reviews.groupby("author")[["overall"]].mean().reset_index(), 
                        on="author")
                    .pipe(lambda x: x[(x["overall"] >= 8)])
                    .sort_values("overall")
                    .pipe(lambda r: r[r["count"] >= 5])
                    [["author", "overall"]])

-   Block 4:

        temp = reviews.groupby("author")["overall"].agg(["count", "mean"])
        pop_auth = (temp[(temp["count"] >= 5) & (temp["mean"] >= 8)]
                    .sort_values("mean")
                    .reset_index()[["author", "mean"]])

Three of the blocks above correctly assign `pop_auth` to a DataFrame
that is equivalent to the table outputted by the SQL query at the top of
the page (ignoring the names of the resulting columns and the values in
the index). One of the options **is incorrect**.

Which block is **incorrect** --- that is, which block **does not**
assign `pop_auth` so that it is equivalent to the result of the SQL
query at the top of the page?

( ) Block 1 ( ) Block 2 ( ) Block 3 ( ) Block 4
