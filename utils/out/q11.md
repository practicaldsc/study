All airports have IATA codes, which are strings of three uppercase
letters that uniquely identify the airport. For example, Detroit's IATA
code is `"DTW"`. Many of the entries in the `"content"` column of
`reviews` use IATA codes to describe the route flown.

We define a **route string** as being a pair of IATA codes separated by
`"-"` or `" to "` (pay close attention to the spacing). For example, in
`test_review` there are two route strings, `"YWG-LHR"` and
`"EDI to YWG"`:

    test_review = """I recently traveled YWG-LHR and returned home from 
                     EDI to YWG with AC Rouge. I must say I was
                     pleasantly surprised with how well the trip went
                     in both directions, but I'm glad I didn't have to
                     transit in ORD."""

Fill in the blank below with a regular expression that matches valid
route strings.
