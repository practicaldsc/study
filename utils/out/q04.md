The bar chart below shows the distribution of the number of reviews per
`"author"` in `reviews`. For instance, it's telling us that
approximately 120 `"author"`s wrote 2 reviews. **Assume that the height
of the bar at 8 on the $x$-axis is exactly 1, and that this is the
shortest bar (with no ties).**

Hint: The **values** in the Series that results from calling
`value_counts()` are sorted in descending order.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blank below so that `W` evaluates to the value `7`.

    W = reviews["author"].value_counts().__(i)__

`(i)`:

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

Now, consider the values defined below.

    W = reviews["author"].value_counts().value_counts().loc[1]
    X = reviews["author"].value_counts().value_counts().iloc[1]
    Y = reviews["author"].value_counts().value_counts().index[1]
    Z = reviews["author"].value_counts().value_counts().index[-1]

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which value is equal to **8**?

( ) `W` ( ) `X` ( ) `Y` ( ) `Z` ( ) None of these.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which value is equal to **the height of the tallest bar**?

( ) `W` ( ) `X` ( ) `Y` ( ) `Z` ( ) None of these.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which value is equal to **the height of the second-tallest bar**?

( ) `W` ( ) `X` ( ) `Y` ( ) `Z` ( ) None of these.
