Suppose we'd like to build a regression model to predict the width of a
fish, given its height, weight, and species. Consider the following two
possible approaches to building linear regression models:

-   **Approach 1**: One hot encode species using
    `OneHotEncoder(drop="first")`, use height and weight as-is, and fit
    a linear regression model.

-   **Approach 2**: Fit 7 separate sub-models, one for each unique value
    of species, where each sub-model is a linear regression model that
    uses height and weight only.

    -   For instance, one of the 7 sub-models would be for the Perch
        species; we'd query the training data to keep only the rows
        corresponding to the species Perch, then fit the Perch sub-model
        on just this subset of the training data.

    -   To predict the width of a new fish, we use the sub-model
        corresponding to the new fish's species.

    Assume that in **both** approaches, the linear regression models
    being considered include **intercept terms**.

Suppose the mean squared error on the training set for approaches 1 and
2 are $\text{MSE}_1$ and $\text{MSE}_2$, respectively. Fill in the :

$$\displaystyle \text{MSE}_1 \:\:\: \boxed{???} \:\:\: \text{MSE}_2$$

Suppose we visualize both models in 3 dimensions, where one axis
represents height, one axis represents weight, and one axis represents
predicted width.

Fill in the blanks: In the 3 dimensional space described above,

the fit model in **approach 1** looks like \_\_(i)\_\_ \_\_(ii)\_\_
\_\_(iii)\_\_,

while the fit model in **approach 2** looks like \_\_(iv)\_\_
\_\_(v)\_\_ \_\_(vi)\_\_.

# END SUBPROB

It is possible to construct a design matrix $X'$ such that approach 2 is
implemented as a single linear regression model, rather than 7 separate
linear regression models.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

How many columns are in the design matrix, $X'$?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

In 1-2 English sentences, describe how to create $X'$. Then, sketch an
example of how $X'$ might look, including at least two example rows, one
of which should correspond to a fish of the Perch species with a height
of 50 and weight of 25. Feel free to use ellipses, \..., in your answer.
