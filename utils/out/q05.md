Suppose we'd like to build a regression model to predict the width of a
fish, given various features. Consider the six line graphs shown below.

::: center
![image](final-images/curves.png){width="60%"}
:::

In each part, select the graph that **best** represents the relationship
between model performance (drawn on the $y$-axis) and the provided
hyperparameter (drawn on the $x$-axis).

First, suppose we build a **$k$-nearest neighbors regression** model, as
seen in Homework 8.

from Homework 8, $0 \leq R^2 \leq 1$, where larger values of $R^2$
indicate better predictions.*
