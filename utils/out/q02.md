Consider the function `operate`, defined below.

    def operate(df):
        df["content"] = df["content"].str.split().str.len()

Consider the following six answer choices:

1.  Nothing, because we didn't reassign `reviews` after calling
    `operate(reviews)`.

2.  `reviews["content"]` now contains the number of characters per
    review.

3.  `reviews["content"]` now contains the number of words per review.

4.  We see an error because we're trying to use `.str` methods on an
    invalid column.

5.  We see an error because a column with the name `"content"` already
    exists.

6.  We see an error because we're assuming `df` is a DataFrame but it is
    `None` (null).

All three parts of this question are **independent** from one another;
the code in earlier parts should not influence your answers in later
parts.
